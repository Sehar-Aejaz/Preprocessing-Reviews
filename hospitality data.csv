I was able to set up my site and reservation system in less than a week. Site works extremely well on mobile devices (which is huge). I am starting to get a lot of direct online bookings which is amazing. The customer service is very good - I have asked several detailed how-to questions. In one case, I wanted to do something that is not part of the Lodgify product. The service rep researched other ways to accomplish the task and integrate into my site.

Gives me time to worry about running my business and expanding the website instead of doing all the manual processes associated with bookings."," Some of the widgets are a little restrictive. I have managed to work around most of them. My only other complaint is that if you respond to an inquiry with a quote, the system automatically blocks the dates with a tentative booking. I sync my HomeAway, VRBO etc calendars with my Lodgify calendar, so the tentative block causes those calendars to show unavailable.

They always respond quickly and we noticed that they're open to suggestions for improvement of certain features. Apart from the software a openminded, young, dynamic organisation, that values the relations with their customers and always try to improve their services and product, is the right partner for us. This is exactly how we operate and like our partners to operate. And that's exactly what it feels like: that we're partners. Please never loose that Lodgify team: that's what distinguishes you from the rest. We carefully choose you around 5 years ago and we never regretted our choice. If you ever want to brainstorm about new features or want to test things, we gladly would help you. It's in this perspective that we wrote down 5 points of improvement. ;)","We have got some tips for you guys: 1. Please don't give us so many language possibilities for the automatic emails. Every time a obscure language is added I have to replace your suggested text with ours. And because there are so many different type of emails, one extra language costs me at least 2 hours of boring labor. Or at least give us the opportunity to choose in which languages people can get a response by email. 2. Please add the possibility of a secured environment for guests to leave their credit card information including CVC code, so that we can debit the card for payments. For us this would be the real step forward! 3. Ad a column to the CVC files with the payment method (comes in very handy with bookkeeping). 4. When marking a booking as payed, instead of adding the payment manualy, at the moment it's not possible to add the payment method. I solve the problem by adding a note. But when downloading the CVC-file a have to add the payment method manualy. It takes a lot of work, which can be solved by adding the column Payment Method in the options for the CVC-file in combination with the possibility of adding the payment method as an option, when marking the booking as payed. 5. Can there be a rainbow flag icon added, so that we can easily show on the homepage that we're gay friendly? This weekend we're gonna try for the second time to ad one ourselves. Fingers crossed that we will succeed this time. ;))",Source: Capterra,"December 17, 2017",-1,-1,-1,-1,5,5,5,5,5,10/10,,

From the beginning and starting with the owner Fred, we trained then trained some more on many of the facets of this system; and we are still learning after 5 months. But the tools offered make our lives better with more time to focus on guests and running the bed and breakfast. If I had one concern it would be about the costs. In our previous system that only offered a guest to reserve through our web site it cost $200 per year. Credit card process was separate and was one of the cheapest providers. Now the fee is over $1700 per year with Resnexus plus other fees from separate companies for icloud, allocator and higher credit card fees.

For example, my weekend, Friday and Saturday has a higher rate and also a 2 night minimum. Currently, the system allows them to reserve for a Saturday plus Friday or Sunday. Sunday through Thursday is a cheaper weekday rate. Also since we are remotely located, if a guest books for Saturday, probably 70% of them will select Sunday. Friday then will not be occupied.

However, you will drive yourself to the point of insanity trying to make changes, and other things that aren't straight forward. I.E. a one night reservation.- That being said, customer service is always there to help. I feel that the price, is not too expensive for only having to pay one company that can do so many things for your business. My only suggestion to them is to update the reservation system, making it more user friendly or idiot proof. I've only been using it for a few months. Maybe I'll get it down by the end of the year! !!!."," I like the look of the ""grid"" , making a reservation is fairly simple, ability to prepare taxes, and the link to the credit card system.

The support team will eventually fix it, but you look like an idiot when you're trying to do this in front of a customer or on the phone. I'm not a computer programmer, but you would think you could click 7 days on the grid, hit ""reservation"" and it would populate a ""weekly"" rate. Not by hitting ""accommodations"", ""remove"" -(removing their original one, so if you f-up, hit ""back"", you try and find their original reservation, woops! its gone. You have to ""remove"" their original one in order to ""add or change anything"".

It's as if because you are paying monthly they want it to take as long as possible. To be fair our campground is not a simple campground and does have some complexities.

Then they gave us attitude about how we hadn't trained our people on using the system in the 2 months we'd been working on setting it up. We can't train people to use a system that isn't set up properly.

Also, Resnexus is more expensive than many of the other booking sites, especially because we have only 5 guest rooms and their price structure is too high for a small inn like ours. They are pretty much inflexible about giving a business like ours a discount for a major loss of business during the Covid pandemic. Also, when we felt they made an error and allowed a customer to book a shorter stay when we had a 3 night minimum they refused to acknowledge any responsibility or to give us any discount for the revenue we lost.","We have stayed with Resnexus now for the full 11+ years we have been in business because theirs was the only software that offerred all the features and flexibility we needed -- like being able to customize rates for different rooms for special event periods, number of guests, special discounts, pets etc. We could show the customer exactly what they needed to know, or we could adapt each booking to be exactly what we wanted."," You pretty much have to customize one room at a time each time you want to make a change.

The only other concern for us has been that delivery and collection has to be booked as an actual item and not offered at Checkout.

For us Checkfront was the outstanding candidate, given our very specific requirements but it did take a bit of time to become familiar with it and configure it to our needs. Once set up though it is easy to move from one season to another (we are a ski Club).

For vacation rental managements, this software in it's current version is very awkward & time consuming to update rates, descriptions, etc if the property falls in more than one category, such as a being 4 bedroom, ski-in/ski-out, base area location, private hot tub & pet friendly. For each category, rates need to be added for that property each time a rate change or new set of dates is added. It seems to be that there should be a main listing that communicates with each of the categories the property is listed under. In the initial set-up, an ""alias"" can be used, but once the property is up, new rates, fees, taxes, etc have to be added to the property in each category it is listed under. Takes way too much time to do things this way. Needs to be an option to ""link"" the same property throughout each category it is listed in so rate adjustments can be done with just one entry. 2. Wish they had ongoing telephone support though the email support works well 3.

Discovering how good it is takes time and frustration. Going from manual pricing to online quoting taught me that the human brain can do things so much more easily than an automated system which has its limits. It took me a while to figure out what I could do and could not do in the pricing possibilities that I could offer. Having said that, the Checkfront system is pretty damn impressive in what it can do but a slog to find out the limitations."," The invoicing and notification system is excellent. It allows for a sequence of events - the initial request and removal of item from inventory, the paying of a deposit and the sending out of a reminder for the balance. It has also allowed us to record bookings that come from another listing site. The notification system is good but , as with with all automatic sequences, you need to think carefully before setting a sequence in train because the same message notification might not be right for everyone. It takes a lot of thought to set up the generic sequence that will most often be used. However, it is very easy to make adjustments to the message before it goes out."," Checkfront may be used more for booking tours rather than holiday homes but it's flexibility allows for many different set-ups. Therein lies the problem with regard to the help pages. They are quite helpful with regard to what any particular feature is but most examples tend to be about booking tours rather than accommodation. I spent a lot of time working out what I could do and how I should do it, more or less by trial and error. In some ways that is a good thing because I learnt so much more about the system by the sheer repetition of trying so many ways to do something. However, it would have saved me a lot of time to have some real examples of how to set up and overcome particular problems. So far, I have only two irritations with the software. One is the mobile phone app which could be much improved but is not actually a bother because I really do not need to carry my office in my pocket. The other is the Inventory calendar. I wish I could highlight the row that I am working on because it is very easy to start making alterations to the wrong row. I also wish that I could highlight a period of time to add or remove a property from inventory. You can only do that one day at a time which is tedious and non-intuitive.

It has definitely improved how we manage our reservations and are constantly learning about new features and how others work."," This is very user friendly, both on the back end/set up side as well as the user side. The reservation system we used to use is extremely limited. We love that we can create a reservation and easily make changes.

For the app, we are unable to check booking documents or update the reservations. That's great that we can check them in, but if they need to add a feature or change their dates at time of check in, we have to switch over to the web version, then switch back for payment. Which is another issue. We have connected checkfront with square, and a lot of the payments don't register with checkfront, so we have to first take the payment, and then record the payment. Very frustrating. We already had a few issues with the checkfront reports, which we have been able to work around, but now that we have connected to square, we are finding it extremely difficult to balance and now our bookkeeper has to refer to multiple reports, which of course does not help. One huge thing that would help is that our items in checkfront be able to communicate with square directly. Right now they convert over and say 'Custom Amount'. In one square report the booking id is referenced, but not others. Very, very frustrating.

The support provided by the team throughout the customisation process was always fast, easy to understand and tailor made for me.","After operating our business for years without an online, pre-paid bookings system we had no idea of the positive impact Checkfront would have, not just for our business but for our lives. Red Star Music is a recording studio and rehearsal spaces and there was initial concern that introducing this type of system would 'scare away', deter or frustrate existing customer but to our surprise, the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. It has been a win/win situation for everyone. Pros for customers: * No longer have to rely on getting in touch with us to book and check availability. * No longer have to request invoices. * Checkfront with the addition of digital access to the spaces means we are able to be open 24hrs a day, 7 days a week. Pros for us: * Protection from financial losses due to people not showing up for bookings, cancelling last minute and refusing to pay. With Checkfront's pre-paid system and our compulsory terms of agreement, the responsibility is placed entirely on the customers to organise themselves. * Protection from human error during the bookings process (on our part). * We are now open 24hrs/7 days a week and no longer are required to have onsite staff members collecting payment whenever there are bookings. * We have more time to focus on other aspects of the business and our lives rather than having to be on call around the clock. Our phones are very quiet these days and we have more bookings than ever.","Understanding that our needs are fairly complicated when it comes to a customised bookings system, there are really only a few very minor things: It'd be nice to be able to set a rule that a certain time slot booking can only be booked when another before it is in place. For example - we'd like to run a 2hr discount session from 9-11pm as a gap filler on week days but we only want customers to be able to book that session if a 5-9pm session is already booked so that we aren't blocking a potential 4hr 7-11pm, higher value session. Does that make sense? No biggie though! There are a couple of things with the mobile app however: 1. If I'm away and I want to check tomorrow's bookings on my phone to see whether I need to be there or not, I can open the app and see in the list of customers from earliest to latest (top to bottom), but I have to tap into each individual customer to see what time they are actually booked, making it difficult for me to get and overall visual of how I'm going to organise the day, hire gear etc. 2. I often want to be able to contact customers when I'm away to give them instructions but there doesn't seem to be any way for me to access contact details, phone/email for the bookings in the mobile app. Being able to tap copy their phone numer and send a quick text would make life much easier.",Source: Capterra,"August 20, 2018",-1,-1,-1,-1,5,4,5,4,5,10/10,,

For example in fishing boat. I cannot click to change and add a commission amount to all. I want to modify items by group outside of the inside of each tour item. I want to copy and duplicate a group instead of having to copy the parent, then the children, and the wrapper. It makes for more mistakes. Also a copy should warn you to update to the correct child links after being copied, and before your save. I don't like that I cannot assign different commission amounts depending on whom I am paying I don't like that I can only send deposit or full balance. I don't like that I can't place a rule that adds a 5% fee after they pay deposit if they want to them make final full payment. I wish there was a way that the reports could just report deposits minus commissions due. I hate the outside GUI, the internal database is super in comparison. Outside looks and feels super clunky and you should use something like elementor technology for visual moving the parts in the back end for greater design functionality. Then peoples designs can look different and we can add or remove features as needed, we should be able to save or use template designs depending in the style of tour we sell.

For example, we offer 2 different overnight tours - the 2-day Seal Cove Adventure and the 3-day Cape Chignecto Adventure. We cannot run those tours parallel or overlapping - it is either one or the other -, so we set the availability to 0 by hand in the inventory the other tour every time an overnight tour gets booked.

We expected that the Go Live process wouldn't be perfect, but their complete lack of customer support and communication concerning very urgent issues is unacceptable. Our properties are actively losing revenue every day this continues. Our customer service is suffering. We are unable to complete accounting reports and prepare monthly tax liabilities. For a company whose self-proclaimed mission is ""to champion the independent sector and help small hotels, B&Bs, and accommodation providers succeed online"", it is unsettling that our repeated requests for technical support have gone ignored. By limiting their clients' ability to govern their own account settings, Eviivo has made itself essential in this process. Not responding to support requests or even acknowledging them is simply unacceptable. The magnitude of the switchover from ReZovation is irrelevant; Eviivo imposed this deadline on its customers, not the other way around. The setup process was focused on making sure our properties were optimized for OTA searches rather than ensuring that our understanding of the process was clear.

I have spent hours researching other programs in the past and for the price never found one to match the capabilities of RezOvation desktop. But now I will be looking again because we are now charged a monthly subscription (as most now do) and find the new system cumbersome.

eviivo,"Hospitality Property Management Software ,Hotel Channel Management Software",Sean S.,Controller,"Hospitality, 11-50 employees",Hospitality,11-50 employees,Used the software for: 2+ years,“7 years of pulling my hair out...”,"So many growing pains! We've had the software for about 7 years, and I have really mixed feelings. This product has so much potential, but it seems that it's being executed poorly at times, with perhaps some questionable development decisions. When we first began using the software, we had a credit card terminal to process payments, but opted to use the internal credit card processing for a more streamlined process. Initially, there were a lot of problems getting the systems end-of-day to correspond with the credit card processing end-of-day. This resulted in a challenge in reconciling our bank statement, because the amounts funded did not match the daily totals from the system. After a lot of time spent working on this, we were able to have this situation resolved, and the system worked okay for quite awhile. RezOvation is locked into using one of two (the second recently added) credit card processors. This in and of itself might not be a bad thing, except that in this case the primary processor is Intuit Payment Solutions. Intuit has chosen to implement policy restrictions on issuing refunds which boggles the mind. After 90 days has passed from the date of the charge, it's impossible to issue a refund back to the card that was charged. Unacceptable! For a resort that takes advance deposits, this is an unnecessary burden. It creates delays, additional workload, and negative guest experiences. Accuracy of reporting is a critical part of any PMS. It seems a lot of hotel software I have tried has an achilles heel in the reporting, not necessarily all reports, but each product seems to have at least one area that is questionable. RezovationGT is no different. On the Daily Summary report, there are categories that show totals for groups, and for advance deposits taken/ used which have no supporting reports to show how those totals are calculated. This makes it difficult to audit if the day is out of balance. The online segment of RezOvation is also very difficult to deal with. We originally had it set up so our guests could make reservations through our website via Webervations. It seemed to work okay at first, but then they went through a PCI compliance audit, and changed how payments were taken. The payments became ""tokenized,"" so you could not see card details within the system. There were other issues with this process as well as batch-out time issues, which made it a no-go for us."," Ease of use. Support is always available during normal business hours, and no wait time. Customization of reports and letters. Automated letters for reminders and follow-up with guests. Excellent up-time. No Night Audit process necessary.","The largest problem I have with this product is the lack of ability to choose your own credit card processor. You are basically stuck with two options, Intuit (awful), and InnPayment which I have not tried yet. Our resort takes advance deposits up to one-year in advance of arrival. Many of our guests return year after year, and so opt to make their next year's reservation when departing. The problem arises if their plans change... Intuit will not allow a refund to a credit card after 90 days has passed, which means we have to write a company check. This might not seem like a huge problem, but the additional workload for doing refund checks, combined with the delays in check processing for our European customers makes it a customer service nightmare. I like the amount of customization options in the reports and letters, but the lack of code for certain things bothers me. Also, the lack of supporting detailed reports for some daily reporting totals (adv. deposits used) makes auditing difficult at times. The real problem seems to be the lack of supporting reports. For example, there is a daily summary report which has values for many categories, cash, visa, gift certificates, revenue, taxes, advance deposits, etc. The problem is that with some of the totals, you don't have access to a detail report to support the total, so it's difficult to audit out of balance issues. They have been working on it gradually, but there's still a couple of categories that need detail reports",Source: Capterra,"August 22, 2016",-1,-1,-1,-1,2,3,4,2,3,2/10,,

There are a few things that I wasn't happy with but you will find pros and cons to every channel manager etc The price for the amount/type of rooms you have can go up. So it is preferable for those with less or fewer types of rooms. But is still a milestone cheaper than any of the competitor such as free to book, my allocator or eviio. This is mainly because Xotelia doesn't charge commission on bookings. So you can save a lot, if you get most of your bookings on OTAs. The customer service is fantastic. My account manager Sorin was nothing but amazing. Super helpful and he really knows what he's doing. Rarely did I have a problem that he couldn't find the solution to. However, there were times that I had to pressure or spam him to get things done. There were days where he couldn't get back to me until the evening, and others where he would be with me the whole day, and I could get a lot done. But this is understandable, Xotelia is a growing company so the staff can sometimes have too much on their plate. And as we were just starting off there was a lot more to do. We also had an issue where my account manager put in the wrong codes for the rooms, which led to a few over bookings. But this was quickly and urgently dealt with. Another thing to note is that although the xotelia admin dashboard is great. You do need to spend the time to learn and get used to it. Your account manager will not do everything for you, or spoon feed you. I had to put in room codes, fill in descriptions etc. This is great at the same time because it helps you to understand the xotelia admin dashboard better. A few other nitpicks. Xotelia does not support some OTAs such as Priceline, kayak. However, there is a huge variety, including a two-way connection with Airbnb which I don't think any other channel manager offers. I was also upset that Xotelia didn't offer the automated email Trip review service for trip advisor reviews. Which their competitors free to book, and myallocator do. I contacted both xotelia and TripAdvisor regarding this matter. And got a 'no' from both. Please note that these are all issues that I have faced personally, and take nothing away from what a fantastic service this really is.

I was looking for the cheapest channel manager and the Xotelia was the one. They don't have many features but definitely, cater our requirement. Initially, setup was bit painful because we had to enter all existing bookings into an excel file and then upload. Most of other channel managers like SabeeApp.com had cool features like importing all existing bookings automatically so that we don't have to do a thing.

It was as every problem I presented was the first time they had ever heard of such a mythical beast. Most of my problems were solved be trial and error on my part and not guidance from tech support. The one incident that comes to mind is that my hostel world account was set to US dollars and Sirvoy to Pesos (or vice a versa).

However, there are a few small changes that would benefit us greatly. Firstly, it would helps us out a lot if pricing didn't average out over multiple nights at different rates. If totalscould be calculated using the individual night rates in stead of an average, that would allow us to round out all of our totals and not end up with odd amounts (I would love to explain this further to someone if you were interested and it was unclear as described.) Furthermore, in switching bookings from one unit to another, it would be great if we could simply swap one unit for another instead of having to move one out of the way then move the other into the first unit before dragging the first booking back into the new unit. The lack of this function has required us to create internal-only dummy units in order to move guests between different units on nights when we have a full house. Again, if you would like me to elaborate on this, I would be happy to. There are a few other things that it would be nice to change on the channel manager side of things, but a lot of that is down to the other websites getting their acts together to better accommodate hostels than it is anything you guys could do about (for example, Expedia is not very useful for hosts who charge by the occupant and put multiple reservations in the same room when linked to Sirvoy, as they consider each of our individual units to be one reservation and not one person. We use units in Sirvoy as individual beds/individual guests, one bed per guest, so when Expedia reservations with multiple guests come through the channel manager it places them in one bed together at the rate of only one bed, something we do not allow.) If anyone at Sirvoy would like any further info about any of this, I would be happy to oblige.

So far, we've only used the system for the free trial period, uploaded our data, and taken one new reservation, but it seems to be working well and we're happy with it.","Our data didn't upload correctly, particularly taxes, and required many corrections, but they helped a lot with the process. We both have accounting backgrounds and have been using a reservation system for 10 years, yet initially still found this one confusing (partially due to terminology but also some aspects, such as their payments & reporting, are very different). Better online tutorials would be appreciated (or get a tech person to walk you step x step through the whole booking & invoicing process. Someone did that for us and it was really helpful - they're always willing to assist!). One thing that doesn't work well for Canadian businesses is the only tax option is for tax to be included in pricing. In order to be ""in additional to"" pricing, as is standard in Canada, we had to add tax using their only 3 available ""surcharge"" fields. Now we don't have surcharge fields available for other optional purchases that need to be applied to every night of the stay (eg extra bed charge - when added as an ""extra"", our guests have to click on the selection once for every night of their stay - very awkward). So far the Sirvoy reporting system doesn't appear to provide the data we are used to, but we're hopeful that it's partly a learning curve and perhaps there's more available than we've found at this time.

And the support makes me feel safe as it's a big responsibility that everything works."," I am an owner of a hotel that I suddenly inherited a few years ago. I took over when the booking system was very dated and I needed the best, the simplest and the most user-friendly booking system on the market with the absolute best and quickest support. I spent several hours in meetings on the computer with the salesmen of different booking systems as they went over their software through screen sharing. What I found was that Sirvoy was the simplest way to get the best overview about what is going on at the hotel. It also has the best option with the mobile view and it´s user-friendly. It became a total relief for our bookkeeper as everything you want goes through Sirvoy, even renting out staff for weddings or renting out our gift shop itself. The customer support is totally outstanding and I can say that with confidence, needing a lot of help with a lot of things in the beginning. Nothing is too big or too small and they always see it to the end with a smile and lightning fast. Sirvoy support listens to us customers when we come with ideas of ""how to make the software even better"". Everything comes with an easy and competitive price model.","I only have detailed things on my wish list for the software. For example, the system doesn't support one reservation if a company wants to book a couple of nights, several weeks in a row. Instead, they need to make each stay an individual reservation. In my case, the travel agent got 10 different emails and booking numbers for the same person. However, I can create an invoice with all reservations on the same page, it just can't be done when making a reservation, just yet. Also, I understand the complexity about channeling different OTA's such as Booking.com. And if one OTA decides to update/make a change, we sometimes get caught in between (as happened to me), but Sirvoy is right there on the phone, on chat or email to help figure everything out. Oh. And I love how easy it is to close the hotel for weddings etc and how the guests with a code make their own reservations. However, I'd really prefer if the code was above the date-calendar and not below as some guests get stuck with not being able to retrieve the datesbecause the code comes after And. I'd love it if I could just use the ""add-ons"" without having to make a hotel reservation. Sometimes the guests want to invite friends to join them at breakfast. It would be great to have the system being able to create a receipt for ""just breakfast"" without looking like they stayed in a room.

The Sales Team offered me a discount if I started the migration right away and although I was hesitant I agreed - No time like the present right. Unfortunately, it was the beginning of the busy season and I couldn't do it and I asked if we could postpone the migration until the end of the season and they were more than happy to comply. The move is relatively seamless but it is tedious work if you want to bring everything with you, that being said I wish some more of the functionality had been explained prior to the migration because I would have been able to make better decisions on how we specifically were going to handle different situations and I would have done things much simpler. An Inn starting from scratch would be super simple. Our Inns have unique rooms so we had to make a room type for almost every room which requires a little more time for everything that follows, but the end result is worth it. I work hard on yield management and InnRoads has many capabilities that RezOvations did not offer that I now take full advantage of. This also translates into their Booking Engine capabilities. First, you set up your seasons, then your rates, then minimum stays (discuss this with your Implementation person first as there are several ways you can set this up). It seems like a lot of steps, but once it is all in there it is super easy to work with. Adding a short term special is very easy, especially if it is a discount off of your Rack rate. You can automate some, all or none of your emails - so handy. The reports are well put together and easy to use. The search capabilities are wonderful - you can find a booking by the last four digits of their Credit card. I mainly moved over because of the cost. With RezOvations and using Bed & Breakfast.com to link to the OTA's for two properties. We have easily cut the cost in half. I thought I would be giving up a lot of functionality with the reduced cost, but I have actually gained much more control of my rates. Just do it...it's worth it. The Support team is very responsive. I have had a few little bugs, which I may have caused myself, but they have cleared them all up relatively quickly."," Very easy to use, very easy to set up. Credit card set up is a breeze, we did switch credit card processors. Booking Engine came together beautifully, we put both Inns together. The link to the OTA's - three for each property (Expedia, Booking & Trip Advisor) and we only had brief troubles with one of them - was easy. If you are having reservations about moving just take it slow and steady one piece at a time and you will get there unscathed."," My main complaint and I think this is only because I was moving over from another system, is that the functionality of things were not explained. The Sales Department gives its pitch and then you are turned over to an Implementation Team which I think should ask a lot more questions about how you run your business than they did. We would have saved a lot of time, effort and frustration. A simple example is in some of their List Items, you enter all your Market Segment options in setup for a drop down menu that appears on the Reservation screen. Had they told me that the drop-down list shows up in the order that you enter them I would have entered them in a much different order. Simple stuff like that would have been very handy to know in advance. The housekeeping functionality is seriously lacking, but I haven't really seen a system that has a good one.",Source: SoftwareAdvice,"January 27, 2017",-1,-1,-1,-1,5,5,4,4,5,10/10,,

Be sure you are prepared for booking out your hotel as this software increased efficiency and exposure quickly enabling you to sell all your inventory. Be prepared with the appropriate staff and supplies. The software continues to innovate and new features and functions are added frequently. You can take advantage of features instantly due to the cloud software. No worries about getting out of date software or requiring an IT specialist to help you roll it out. The people are the greatest value of the software,I bought a hotel management software package to save me from the liability of storing credit cards. I chose innRoad because it had to be cloud software so i can access it from any device with multiple users. It fulfilled all these requirements to my expectations. The sales and implementation team confidently shared projected growth that would more than pay for the software subscription. They were right and then some. I grew my business by 300% due to the ease of connectivity to all the booking sites such as Expedia and Booking.com that brought in new business. My favorite feature is the customer service and responsiveness. No issue I raise goes unaddressed nor am I left alone to solve my issues. Impressively they even offered time to help train my employees. Since I went from a manual paper based system to booking software I can't compare experiences between software vendors but I have to say if you have any home grown or manual systems I can't recommend more passionately that you need to consider innRoad.," The software has a full feature set that can be overwhelming.

Although I did not start with Inn Road software integration from the beginning, it has proved to be useful in operations for the small 39 room hotel I operate. To make a long story short, I started as the GM last year in 2015; without training from my predecessor. I've not experienced such a cloud based software before, rather my strong suite was with another brand in a POS/Hospitality software. Being tossed into a new software, well. . . I only had my knowledge of computers and my wit to figure out applications being hindered and harbored in the technological era. After a month and a half, I've caught onto how the system operates. It wasn't too difficult to adapt to the generalities of how Inn Road Operates. In most areas I prefer the ease of Inn Road. Not only because I caught on fast in the areas needed to manage the hotel and all the reservation types that come wit it, but it allowed for me and others to correct ourselves prior to saving our mistakes. To explain, required information needs to be filled out prior to advancing and saving anything. It may seem archaic in regards to applications or forms have always required fields to be filled in before proceeding, but I've never had this luxury with the original operating system I've used. This has been beneficial and is a great regarding the software because it no longer requires many reports to be printed and trying to find the origin of the mistake to make corrections from the beginning. Overall, Inn Road has and continues to save time, which in return saves money, and sanity. I've always appreciated the cliché phrase ""Work smarter, not harder."" In my opinion, Inn Road's software allows me to accomplish this objective."," Employee Mistakes are easy to find and correct. Simple enough to remember the corrective action once experienced. For example, how to change a room using parking lot. It has a question mark in the upper right that allows you to search for tips and read up on the features. The customer service has never let me down. If I have a question I either call in or email, depending on my time constraints. They've been great with their help and responses to my staff and myself. If it is something that they are unable to manage or correct from their stand point, then it is passed to the IT department to investigate. Inn Road takes care of Credit Card processing during the Audit process. We just have to run the reports and post everything from the day officially. Other than that, it is a simple print of the reports."," There are features I miss that an older software I used had; like having a DO NOT RENT LIST for trouble guests. The software is still learning and I consider it a Beta Phase until they've incorporated many features that people are requesting to see with the software. Lock night audit periods!!

That being said there are some major draw backs. I initially went with InnRoads because i wanted a online booking platform that could be integrated into my website. Due to the inflexibility of the platform and its inability to handle the subtleties and nuances of my booking requirements, I was not able to use this as a online booking utility. Instead, I use it as a hands on booking tool. For instance, I have seasons where my prices are higher then other times of the year (as I am sure most if not all hotels have) and the default is that if a guest wants to stay during a time that overlaps the two season ranges, InnRoads will always default to the lower price and there is no way of circumventing this default. I can manipulate the system manually, but if someone was booking online, I would lose money. As well, to manipulate this program with all its associations of seasons and rates is particularly challenging.", great customer service. Easy to use once all the seasons and rates and promo codes have be added.,"If you are not a full blown hotel/motel, such as we are (only 6 units) this platform offers much more then needed.

The sales team was super helpful even in showing my mom who is the owner that we would actually be saving time and money by going with a program like there. The implementation team was great especially my rep who had to train me and put up with all my questions. There was a few hiccups that happened but they were remedy almost immediately. My mom who is not tech savvy at all can use the program easily. I also love the fact that I can access the reservation system from anywhere.

On the front end, I do not deny that it has helped us in terms of inventory management and connection with OTAs. Nonetheless, the backend processes have really thrown us into utter disappointment. The support staff were trying to help but often provided workaround solutions that will put the property in a bigger issue. For instance, we had problems with having to manually confirm customers upon successful clearance of payment by Stripe and the solution suggested to us by the Support team is allow for a blanket confirmation regardless of whether the payment is cleared. I was utterly shocked to see that coming from the Support team as this comes at a high level of risk to the property given that the resort will be held accountable for the confirmation email. The reason why we signed up for the Payment Processing module is so that we do not have to worry about receiving payments and do not have to worry about manually confirming payment ourselves. Besides, often when technicalities are involved, the Support team will say they need to speak to the Technical or Development team but without any proper deadline of when the problem will be solved. It is frustrated to deal with problems when there is no timeline attached as to when the problem will be solved. I suggest that the Support team work with the technical team to commit to deadlines for a problem to be solved.", I like it that it is a all-in-one software and it's easy to use.," The payment processing module is far from acceptable. Cloudbeds is integrated with Stripe but the integration is not complete and requires a lot of manual backend work to confirm a reservation once a payment is cleared. One of the reasons for signing up with Cloudbeds is to cut down the amount of manual work backend we have but only to realise later that there are many things that have to be done manually. Manual confirmation required in a tech world - When we thought everything can be automated and Cloudbeds being a digital all-inclusive PMS provider, we were proven to be wrong. Let me give you a scenario, once a customer makes a booking and they choose to pay via credit card, a pending confirmation email gets sent to the customer while Stripe will do the payment verification and the process stops there. My team has to go back to the system to cross check each and every successful transaction and manually confirm the guests so that they get a confirmation email. What Cloudbeds could have done is to actually automatically switch the status of the guest from ""Pending"" to ""Confirm and send email"" upon receiving instructions from Stripe that the payment has gone through (this, at the time of writing remains manual on the part of property). Besides, when a credit card payment fails to be verified by Stripe, Cloudbeds does not store the information of the customer so that we can offer the customer an alternative mode of payment. Basically if the payment fails, the info vanish",Source: Capterra,"February 20, 2020",-1,-1,-1,-1,1,3,2,1,2,0/10,,

Hotelogix,Hospitality Property Management Software,Mindaugas G.,CEO,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Used the software for: Unspecified,“Shakespeare Hotel”,"I used Logix for several month, its a great hotel management program, but still need to be fixed and added more option. I discontinued to use it because during few month i understand that i spend more time by using Logix than i do my reservations by excel program. Main points are these: 1. Logix can't make invoice for several reservations of one group. Means if i would like to get payment from tour agency which sent me 10 customers (10 rooms) i must issue one by one invoice to get a payment. That's a lot of paper work and very confused. 2. I can't understand and follow which reservations been paid and which not, must follow manually. 3. In reports i can't get detail report as i need. Even i can't get specific report for specific dates, for example i need customer list who check in from 1 st of December until 15 of December, so the system show me all customers who use to live between these specific dates. 4. When i add new reservation and during the period of staying our room price change, system of Hotel Logix starting to show strange amounts per night. For example, customer stayed 5 nights for 800$ and 3 nights for 900$, so in the system i got strange amount that customer pay per night: 837.5$ (its not specific as it should be) 5. I can't make an overbooking, for example sometimes we have that customer not arrived, but he paid for the hotel, and i would like to see this reservation in the bottom of table, but night audit not allow this reservation to be in the bottom and i must either delete, either to remove it from the system. (In manual case, i keep reservation in the bottom of the table until customer will arrive) So these the main points which make my decision to not work with Hotel Logix, because even i asked programmers to fix these problems but they was not able to do it. So, in general, this hotel managment program is very suitable for small hotels which has not over 20 rooms, and receive customers from Walk in or booking websites. Of course again its depend on the country and conditions of work.

Hotelogix,Hospitality Property Management Software,Gerry W.,Owner,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Used the software for: Unspecified,“Changing you core PMS system is never easy as every member of staff is affected!”,"We installed Hotelogix about 6 months ago as part of an overall move to cloud based applications. We had been running a system called AvonData for the past five years. Our criteria included support of traditional PMS functions, an integrated web booking engine, channel manager, EPOS and function room booking capability. In addition we wonted a system that seamlessly integrate with other cloud based solutions such as Xero, accounting along with a willingness to interface with revenue management solutions such as PriceMatch and review management systems such as ReviewPro. Support particularly out of normal working hours together with a good issue tracking and account management approach were also important. Cost was a consideration but not our number one priority, we felt that feature/function match, customer support and being part of a large growing company were equally important. Installing a new core system is never easy as it affects your whole business and virtually all members of staff, we made some mistakes such as not fully mapping our requirements and not spending time getting staff 'buy in' six months down the line we are fully live on all modules and starting to reap the benefits of our decision. I like hearing my phone 'ping' with new accommodation bookings seven days a week, twenty four hours a day with no operator intervention. Managing our room stock from a single Global rate System helps me keep on top of the revenue management side of the business, integration with Xero is also a big plus point. We have notice that the system is very functionally rich and although we are only a small country house hotel (18 rooms, function rooms, restaurant) we have some special practices which the system can accommodate. Overall I think the system has some excellent feature/functions supporting our needs now and more importantly in the future.

Recently bid out a competitor and savings were over $100k with a 200+ unit portfolio. Wishing nothing but the best for them but would like to see more competitive bulk pricing and faster to market solutions. If a small company like Hostaway has Expedia integration and multiple payment processors then why is Guesty still behind?, Guesty is always adding features. The current feature set is very robust. Integrations with almost every player in the industry. Bugs and upgrades with every new rollout. Great team and best capitalized company in the industry. Eventually should have the most robust feature set in the industry.,"Constant bugs in the calendar. Same day Airbnb reservations do not get auto assigned meaning you need staff constantly watching Guesty OR lose the ability for same day reservations OR risk an unassigned reservations. No solution or even affirmation of this problem. I have been begging support to resolve this and always get stock copy and paste answers. Support is generally lacking. They respond quickly but never dive deep enough into an issue or offer resolution. Pricing is pretty much the highest in the industry even though the feature set is not the best in class. Still no integration with Expedia or second payment processor. If you have over 2% chargebacks then Stripe will kick you off the platform and Guesty has no alternatives integrated. This is a huge problem. A lot of nickel and diming on pricing. They now want an additional $3/unit for ""advanced analytics"" which is really just basic analytics you would expect from any platform.",Source: Capterra,"June 3, 2021", Hostaway,-1,-1,-1,4,4,2,4,2,7/10,,

Not worth the additional time and effort to fix all their stuff ups. Not worth the money it costs for the onboarding. Not worth the money you will loose in the end from technical issues. Not worth the stress and frustration of not getting any customer service. JUST NOT WORTH IT AT ALL REALLY!!! Oh and before you send me a response to this review Guesty - I have had a number of conversations with your management team and still get nowhere. You say you want to tackle each issue but never really get to the bottom of them. You start with the initial contact or message but then nothing. I don't see why this time would be any different. I'm saddened to have to write this review but unfortunately I don't feel heard even after a year with you!!, The fact that you can see the guests contact details if they type them into an inquiry.,"Once onboarded you were left to your own devises which was very frustrating. At the onboarding they show you what they want to show you, not necessary what you need to know for YOUR business therefore they just don't listen to your needs. You can't call anyone if you encounter issues, the support team blame the other platforms for the problem and says you need to call the platform. They message you back within 24 hours but haven't really looked at your question. You are then palmed off to someone else in the support team and you have to explain yourself again and again. They over charged on a number of bookings and it is still ongoing to try and get the money back. There are so many technical issues/faults with nightly rates and bookings. When you message them they don't give straight answers, and you are then left to clean up the mess ie double bookings, incorrect rates showing.

Their mobile apps are sad and ineffective for our team members, so we go some messaging automation help but no help for our team really communicating. Team members can't communicate directly with any messaging only tasking tools that didn't work according to the permission matrix Guesty published. If you have a desire to be on the biggest channels, this is not your platform. If you need tools and accounting and other services, this is not your platform. We are actually, currently paying 60% of what we would pay for the most robust enterprise level platform that's way beyond our capability to utilize in this industry.

These seem to be the only features that are completely reliable.,"We naively took a recommendation from someone to use Guesty and had a hard time discovering other options out there. Do more research. There are four excellent options that are roughly 40-75% cheaper. The price for this platform is absurd. Tools rarely work as promised. They are not a true channel manager. They only integrate with airbnb and booking.com, but they've been promising ""coming soon"" for serveral other channels forever, but doesn't look like it will happen. If you go with Booking.com through Guesty, you have to live with the 20% cut to Booking.com which didn't help us increase revenue when we already have 85% occupancy. Our only choice there was to actually reduce our revenue, so that was a non-starter. If you're a good operator with high rates and occupancy, I don't know how this platform can do anyting but stagnate your growth. Only banks, cable companies and Guesty gets away with saying, ""sorry for the inconvenience"" when they're product doesn't work. In every other business is means refunds/rebates/credit/gifts.... something that tells your customer you regret you failed to meet the expectations you set. They completely ignored me on every occasion I suggested they should consider crediting us for their inability to deliver a myriad of promises.

Guesty,Hospitality Property Management Software,Wesley S.,President,"Real Estate, 11-50 employees",Real Estate,11-50 employees,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,"“Excellent Software, Terrible Support”","Overall: The software is good, and integrations are good. Not the best, as many are far better in some respects. The customer service is absolutely terrible. The worst I've ever experienced. I've had almost 3,000 AirBnB guests, and talking to them makes me feel like my worst guests as I get repeatedly frusturated at the support team, and feel like i'm not being helped or taken care of. Guesty charges 3% of revenue, which means I pay over $1,000/month for it. If they treat me like this, I can't imagine how they treat smaller hosts that don't make over $20,000/month. I hope that Guesty gets my feedback here, as their customer support has made no comments on whether my direct feedback reaches the Guesty management or ownership teams. I think that while the software is great, on-boarding and support are archaic and severely need updates and improvements. I'm still using the software, but unless there are changes to how they handle client issues and requests, i'll be jumping ship as soon as a comparable software comes on the market. I still have hopes for Guesty, so maybe once my income raises over $40,000 and monthly payments to guesty pass $1,000 overall, i'll be taken as a higher priority client for them."," Guesty has a great intuitive platform. It has all of the features that you'd expect, and they all work fairly well. The feature sets are fine, though they may be found on other platforms, but what you pay for is the integrations. Guesty integrates with nearly all software that you'd expect or want it to. Their chat feature is the most mature, and the best part of the software, but automated messaging leaves much to be desired. It is not possible to set up automated message without customer support (in most cases). Team management and listing management both work as expected, and are a pleasure to work with. The software is definitely among the most developed in the industry.","Overall Guesty attempts to be good at all things, and master of none. There are numerous softwares that do individual things far better, like automation, messaging, cleaning team management. Overall the worst part of the experience of Guesty was the support system. While all softwares use live help nowadays, you have to submit manual tickets to guesty. There is no phone line to call, and you can't ever chat with a representative. While the website claims that they do full set-up, it's wrong. I sent over 40 back and forth messages with support as they tried to have me do my own setup. After requesting help with a particular issue, they did not have a representative do the work for me. On top of that, months into use, the software still doesn't work as expected.

Even https://tokeet.com/ was wise enough to put a note in there. - If you try to set it up yourself instead of waiting for a rep to do it for you, the software will immediately start charging your card without letting you know. - They promised to help simplify my business, but in the end the glitchy software and terrible documentation vastly complicated it. - They promised to scale my ads to many different channels, but did not, in the sales call, mention any of the additional hurdles which would be present in each channel. - It was faster, cheaper and simpler to add the listings to other channels manually then to try to use this software - The sales rep offered a full refund when he found out I was dissatisfied, but then failed to deliver and stopped responding to communications, while still charging my card, weeks after he agreed to issue a refund. - The customer service department is by email only and very slow to respond, so I spent several nights with my system that I worked really hard to create in shambles, cancelling all my plans, trying to fix the errors this system created by hooking it in.

It's also really nice to have such an easy 'modification' of a transaction should there be a change or need to adjust any of the pricing or taxes based on actuals, especially since we are in Mexico and have to convert our Pesos transactions based on the daily exchange rate, which is frequently different from the time of the quote or the first payment to the second payment.

We receive large checks tied to reservations but it takes forever to input because of how the payment system is implemented. Same with changing a room. in order to check someone out early I have to first change the dates of their stay then I can check them out. adding a space to move reservations around would be helpful.

Example: Customer books a room for a birthday weekend stay, Webrezpro needs to present the booking option with a nice size picture of the item that the hotel wants the customer to add-on.

For example, if you want to set up an automated ""guest arrival letter"", you cannot import guest name, check in date or check out date, or check in time. What is the point of this letter if it needs to be so generic that it cannot confirm with a guest their name, date of arrival or anything specific about their booking? I am honestly so surprised by this as the other systems we use are much more advanced than this. This means I must leave a note in my diary to send a personalised letter to each guest on their day of check in confirming their booking details. - The automated letters do not leave a note with the reservation itself. Again any other system I have used, you can click on the reservation and see the correspondance they have received from us.

Reservations does not handle groups well at all. You can book multiple rooms on one reservation but only if all guests arrive and depart on the same days. You can't split rooms off this one group res and you only get one bill for the entire group. You have to enter individual reservations to achieve any real functionality but there's not way to link or connect these independent res as a group. Billing is far too basic. Room charging is fine but you can't charge for other ad-hoc items with any ease and rate changes across a stay are awkward to implement. You can't split bills, can't move charges across rooms and the gust only gets one bill so no way to hide room rates or provide separate bills for company expenses and personal expenses. Room/Rates configuration is also convoluted and requires constant manual work-arounds to function. Reports are basic but useful.

As with any system, there are little things that could be adjusted or added that would make this a 5 star system, but at this time they are not implemented or available. Housekeeping report is very basic. Adjusting the rates is very easy and pushes out to all connected channels correctly. Guest emails and communication is good but could be better and more customization would be an added benefit. Adjusting inventory is a great feature as well and you can control what the OTA's get and stop sells and other features as well. Monthly sales and tax reporting is very basic and needs some added calculations for different tax rates so no manual calculation would be necessary. Color coding could be better to help show room status and payment status is done with a flag, but color coding is easier to read. As one review stated earlier, the reporting is very slim and lacking and mine does not work correctly, but I can get the numbers from other parts of the reporting or do a manual calculation and get the number I am looking for but its most likely a little bug that would be easy to fix. Overall, we are very pleased with this software and the integration with OTA channels and our website works like a charm.

I actually called and arranged a VERY early morning conference call with this European based company.... and this is just one of the crazy, head scratching things about this software. It allows you to imbed a link from them to your own company website for guests to get a quote; but this is a total quote.... No itemized quote. So if you've got a $1000 refundable deposit, guests don't know that, its just this HUGE total, without details on cleaning fee, taxes, options, refundable deposit, etc. From here, the guests can contact you for the itemized quote and book. What the heck? why can't they book on line? why can't they see an itemized quote? This is just one of the things that Smoobu knew hosts would want, but that they didn't bother to do right.... and unfortunately one of so many half way done things .... I guess so they could add it to their feature list, but it is completely useless.

This was the case for me, after reading countless reviews I decided to trial Smoobu and am now a paid user. And when the learning curve is unavoidable, Smoobu truly shines with their CUSTOMER SUPPORT - it is definitely one of their best features. Their chat team works in German-time (and they are not available 24/7), but it was definitely handy when you're based overseas. Their e-mail support team I find are VERY experienced, fast, helpful, patient, understanding and respectful - I seriously only have praise for them! They truly helped a novice channel manager user like myself troubleshoot, configure, and set up the optimal solution that works best for my particular business size and workflow. Regarding the SOFTWARE FEATURES, I think we always tend to want more, and more of the available features offered more seamlessly and automated, so I don't think it's even fair to expect EVERYTHING, and the simplicity of Smoobu's software - both in UI and UX, once you get a grip on it, is a HUGE asset that eliminates and minimises all the headaches we go through as owners and managers. And finally - PRICING. Based on my own research I think their overall quality offering is astounding vis a vis the cost. I am thoroughly impressed with the service and am grateful that I found something I am happy to pay for and proud to continue using!"," EMAIL SUPPORT > CHAT SUPPORT: Though chat support is easier to access, for an actual conundrum or a multilayered question you're facing I would definitely go through their e-mail support since they can constructively engage with your problems (maybe also because they have more time to respond?), and you really feel that they are there to help you! But the chat team is great too for small questions you might have (but sometimes they disconnect in the middle of a question - but don't be discouraged and take that to e-mail or maybe call though I haven't tried that personally!) GOOD DESIGN BUT NOT YET MIND-BLOWING: It is minimal, clean and ticks all the right boxes in terms of UI / UX and it is not at all problem for internal admin use, but for someone who comes from a creative industry background (e.g. used to the intuitive approach of Apple products and have done consumer-facing communication work) I do think their consumer-facing features (like their new GUEST APP and WEB EMBEDDABLE BOOKING TOOL) can be further reimagined based to align themselves with consumers who are spoiled by Apple, Google et al. providing great design to the mainstream. So in sum, based on a philosophy that good design looks great and ALSO heightens practicality.

Die Sprache kann dabei nur über die Browsersprache eingestellt werden - eine integration in eine Website mit Sprachschalter ist daher nur wenig sinnvoll, denn dafür wäre eine manuelle Festlegung der Sprache notwendig. Die Anforderung wird nicht umgesetzt, da die Funktion der Mehrsprachigkeit laut Anbieter trotzdem gegeben ist. 2. Nehmen wir an, wir leben mit dem ersten Punkt und gehen über die Browsersprache.. Nun kommen wir zur Übersetzung selbst, die mehr als dürftig ist. Die meisten Teile des Tools werden von Smoobu automatisch in 15 Sprachen übersetzt. Das Ganze jetzt noch einheitlich für eine einfache Website zu machen ist quasi unmöglich. Egal, dann bekommt der Benutzer das Buchungstool in seiner Sprache und den Rest auf Englisch. Nächstes Problem: Es können die Zusatzoptionen wie z.B. Nächtigungsabgabe, Stornobedingungen usw. nicht direkt übersetzt werden. Dazu muss immer jeweils der Deutsche und der Englische Text eingefügt werden. Der Outcome ist, dass der Benutzer (egal welche Sprache er spricht) sowohl den deutschen als auch den englischen Text auf der Website sieht.",Source: Capterra,"May 27, 2021",-1," Gutes Marketing, moderne Webapplikation, Flexibilität",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,1,0/10,,

I do not believe the software was ever tested in a live hotel., It has a friendly support team. Night Audit functionality is a breeze.," It lacks even the most basic functions of a PMS: Early check out is not possible. You can't check out a room the same day it has been checked in. This forces you to ""hold"" until it can be checked out. It has almost no options for reports that a front desk agent can print unless they have management access. Housekeeping room status is on a separate tab. This makes it difficult to quickly change a room status and often confuses the housekeeping department. Changing a room number is nearly impossible if the hotel is sold out. The system forces you to slot rooms like a puzzle. If no slots are open it is extremely difficult to change the assigned room number. You can make them unassigned but will receive a ""sold out warning"" and will still not be able to change the assigned number. The billing and creation of invoices is overly complicated and not intuitive. There is also no way to refund a charge processed via the POS. The software also contains many glitches-housekeeping room status seems to change for no apparent reason despite the set rules.

Frontdesk Anywhere,Hospitality Property Management Software,Nicki H.,General Manager,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Used the software for: Unspecified,“Tons of Potential”,"Pro's - Fairly user friendly. Like the ease of integrating website and online booking agents so I only have to manage availability and rates through the FDA system. Like that it is web based and information can never be lost. Simple to train staff of basic functions of the system. Lots of great reporting for future projections and marketing. Con's - Reporting for month end reconciliation purposes needs improving. We had been reconciling to the Trial Balances Report but there is definitely a glitch somewhere. We are not sure why our balances outstanding totals for previous months, that had already past, would change. It should not be changing historical data. This is the main reason for the 3 star rating. T Do not like that you cannot see your check outs from the reservation screen. I know you can select ""check outs"" from the list on the left and get all of your check out for the day but I think it would make more sense to put a line through the middle of each day so you have a clear visual of which units are leaving and arriving rather than having to flip flop between the check out/in lists. It would be nice if you could drag reservations to different units instead of having to go into the folio and transferring that way. Sometimes I can see that there is availability in another unit and it still won't let me transfer guest. I double check dates, refresh screen and still cannot make that unit available although I can clearly see it is. Last time I checked the ""work order"" option was not functioning properly. I could create them but could never delete them as finished. Same with the housekeeping options. Your system should also be able to integrate with the telephone system. We have an NEC and I cannot link my cash calling account software to it. So I have to have a separate program on my hard drive that I have to refer and add the telephone calls to the invoices separately. If all of the functions and reporting worked properly this system would be amazing but unless you can get the reporting rectified or someone can give me a straight answer as to why its changing historical data we will be forced to look at another reservation program...which I don't want to do.",-1,-1,Source: Capterra,"April 7, 2015",-1,-1,-1,-1,3,3,4,-1,-1,-1,,

I decided on FDA. The sales team was helpful. I found it simple to use although I do think there is a lot of unnecessary ""clicking"" that goes on in order to complete certain transactions. I like that I could integrate with all of the OTA's I used and could manage the rates from one site. It did not take me long to get up and running and my staff caught on to the system quickly. Customer service responds quickly but I do feel like other reviewers that my issues are never resolved. Or they are resolved with the promise that they are ""on it"" or ""looking into it"". I still cannot use the Work Order function. It will not let me update the status of a work order and then archive it. I wish they had a ""Today"" button that would just take you back to the day you are on when you are processing future reservations. I wish you could see your check outs for the day from the ""reservation tape"" view. Right now you either have to select the previous day or use the check out options. This could be solved by extending reservation out halfway through to the next day. This way you could see the check out and check in on the same day. The reporting is terrible. Lodging Statistics Report doesn't even load. My bookkeeper can't ever reconcile as the number on the Trial Balance Report changes for the month she thought she already balanced. The last row of this report does not print out all on one sheet. I am told there is new version of FDA but every time I have inquired about it the question virtually gets ignored. If there is....I want it. But I read in a response to another reviewer that there is one but it is only available to new customers??!!! This would be extremely disappointing. Why would you treat your new customers better than your existing ones. I'm ok with paying more for a PMS where I can utilize all of its functions. It is also not compatible with my NEC phone system so I am losing out on telephone revenue. I can install the phone software and then flip flop between the reservation system and the phone software and add the phone revenue but things always get missed and its very time consuming and not efficient. Ultimately I just want to be able to use all the functions. If its there and I can see it it should work. Its like providing a lamp with no bulb to my customers."," User friendly, customer service is friendly and quick to respond, I can integrate it with all of the OTA's and manage rates from one site."," Many functions don't work.

Other than the Cons mentioned, we really have no complaints. It is a difficult system to learn (onboarding/set-up was more difficult than our previous platform; 3-6 months to become comfortable), but once mastered, it is easy to navigate and customize. In hindsight, the difficulties we had were mostly due to the robust functionality, which we use every bit of. If I could make any single change, it would be to streamline the communication with customers by making email templates easily editable/more user friendly, and allowing emails/SMS text alerts to be sent to ALL guests at one time, without the need for a timed template. 3rd party software integration will allow this to be done, but including it in the package would make the system even stronger. Overall, we decided to go with FDA after demoing 3 other systems (the functionality was superior and it checked all of our requirements at the time).

First I will tell you that they are poorly staffed. In all my experience with them, I only dealt with 4 staff members. There was never a time that someone different, outside of these 4 people, answered the phone. Tech support is staffed by 3 of these 4 people, all very nice and accommodating to their best ability, but they cannot keep up with demand. It's not their fault, but a fault of company planning. Beyond this, I have had many glitches with the system itself. Failed credit card transactions for no reason and then I went to our back up manual credit card machine and it went through (both dependent on same ethernet connection). The major issue I have with this program is faulty reporting and functionality. Nothing comes across as you want it to. The housekeeping report, in print mode, has a horrible inefficient layout that takes up the whole page and more. Finally, after many complaints, I started talking to management and they attempted software updates to ""fix the bugs"", however, I'm still unhappy. I have had several bugs even after the update. Most recently, bookings were coming from channel management either in duplicates or not in exact quantity. We had to relocate a guest Memorial Day Weekend because they were supposed to have 5 bookings but came across as 3. Housekeeping status was showing a room that had been checked in as ""clean"". Many glitches that still continue, very disappointed. I believe this company has a true lack of real hotel industry advisors. It is more of an IT company that attempted to go into hospitality and are not hitting the mark. They are very much in the ""start up"" ""tweaking"" phase and using their current customer base as guinea pigs in hopes to finally get to the product they wanted. But if you are like me, you need a product that works now, not in trial mode. Unfortunately I would recommend another company and save your time, even if you are a small 10 room Inn, keep looking elsewhere.",Source: SoftwareAdvice,"June 3, 2016",-1,-1,-1,-1,2,3.5,1,1,-1,3/10,,

However, their will come a time when we will find ourselves equal to a competitor from the customer's standpoint.

Understanding the nature of people and their communication expectations, all schools of thought lead to Zingle. Certainly when a customer pick ups the phone, they expect someone to answer. This is challenging because the phone is only going to ring for ten seconds before they hang up. Furthermore, people are getting less likely to make this call. Expectations regarding an email response vary but timeframes tend to be more leniant. When it comes to text, people, quite frankly, can get their feelings hurt or even angry if you don't answer them immediately. We accept orders 24 hours a day. No one person can respond in an instant 24 hours a day. So if my customer has one number going to multiple people, they get the immediate attention they desire and it's up to us to know who is responsible to answer that text. Most companies don't know how many customers they lose because they cannot reach to someone. But I know how many we lose...zero. We also use it for dispatching our truck drivers. The concept is the same. They require information and assistance 24 hours a day. But they cannot know who is on-call or vacation or out sick. So they have one number to text and someone will see it 24/7/365. This is the best dispatching tool ever.

I had created 150k/year of sales from just airbnb in just a year and new I needed to scale my biz, but I also knew I would not be able to handle more administrative work without finding a way to delegate and automate more fully. I knew I needed to scale to different marketplaces, VRBO, then flipkey, then booking.com... but knew I needed an integrative software to manage that process. I hunted and hunted, I reviewed 50 or 60 tools, pricing structures, features, claims, I tried 20 free trials, I actually set up 8 different tools, until I finally tried this one. While every other tool had a fundamental problem - profoundly over charging, taking a % of your company ( % of sales ), broken essential features like chat features ( tokeet ), broken import/export/linked listing features ( guesty )... this one didnt. Superhost tools was an exception - solid little tool for what it does, but SmartBNB does the same stuff - BETTER... specifically superhost tools automates communication - which is sometimes profoundly out of context but better then nothing, and smartBNB enables review of scheduled messages, which lets you edit them to fit to context. It literally does almost EVERYTHING I could have wanted, but BETTER. While the calendar feature needs a simple fix ( scrolling is the only workable means for that for ease of use like Airbnb ) - THIS is the app to set up and follow.","- $7/listing - No setup costs - Enabled automation of 90% of my communications - I can review communications that are scheduled automatically BEFORE they go out - They don't want a percentage of my COMPANY to provide a killer service ( no % of sales model ) - They are under priced and over deliver - They under sell and overdeliver I have tried SO many tools!! Guesty and Tokeet were so glitchy they cost me money to try to setup. Guesty wanted $1000 just to set me up AND a PERCENTAGE OF MY COMPANY ( % of gross sales ) STAY AWAY from any company like that! Wheelhouse automated my prices, for a PERCENTAGE OF MY COMPANY - meh. Guesty promised to scale my ads and failed miserably. Tokeet's chat feature was garbage, but import/export listing feature was awesome. In the end, you can only hook up one channel manager to your airbnb account, so if your like me, you have got to decide on one at a time. I have tried 8 and reviewed 50-60... and Im done looking. SmartBNB delivered in almost every way I could have wanted. - Dirt cheap for what you get - Perfect communications channel w guests ( I am super picky ) - Seamless automated messages WITH THE ABILITY TO REVIEW THEM BEFORE THEY GO OUT - Bad Review strategies and are automated, rational, and effective - Almost instant, and intelligent customer service - Killer Documentation that actually trains you and almost never confuses you - Phenomenal - like off the charts phenomenal customer service tools.","- The calendar viewing is weak. Its fine because you can just use Airbnbs... but to improve it guys: clicking to go to the next month? Really? You cant scroll to Jan 15th to feb 15th? Fix that. Make it scroll like airbnbs please immediately.

I had dozens of note documents for each property on my iPhone for things like; Check-in instructions, the first morning follow up message, Check-out instructions, etc. I would have to copy/paste these into the messaging apps and found myself making frequent, detrimental errors such as sending check-in instructions for the wrong house to a guest. Another major challenge I was running into before Hospitable was that I couldn't travel easily or do anything that wouldn't have strong cell phone service because I always had to be available to send check-in/out messages to my guests. Hospitable solved all of this and more. After a few weeks using the platform I went from thinking I hit my ceiling at owning and operating 3 homes, to believing I could effectively manage 15 or more. Fast forward to today and my company, Good Life has grown to 8 (soon to be 9) independently owned and managed homes that are all top 10 revenue producers in their respective zip codes, all maintain a 4.9+ overall review, and gets tons of repeat renters. This simply would not be possible without the automated communication SmartBnB enables to our guests and team."," I honestly don't have any cons to list about Hospitable.

When any company over-delivers by as much as ReservationKey as over-delivered, it shouldn't be surprising that they have overly happy users willing to write long-winded online reviews. But if you don't believe that I am a real person, and a real user, just track us down on Google. Our Company is ""Rockies Rentals"". We are based in Canmore Alberta Canada. My name is Charla."," Great Customer Service -- really responsive, and personable. The Built In Website, and Payments. Auto Scheduled Emails. No Contracts; No Set Up Fees. A great price -- well worth the fee even just for someone with one unit, or a small inn. Ease of use. Having Multiple Users. The Mobile Version -- I have easily been taking reservations from a hammock at the beach just on my Smart Phone."," Because the software is made for a myriad of Hospitality Services Providers (Hotels, Campgrounds, BnBs, Vacation Rentals), it's hard to provide the right thing to a diverse group of users. That being said, the User Forum was amazing! If we encountered a quirk that worked well for a Hotel User, but not-quite-right for our needs, there would always be another helpful User who knew how to accomplish what we needed with just a few little User Tweaks. The entire User Forum was full of happy, generous users who were keen to share their ideas and help others.",Source: Capterra,"November 28, 2020",-1,-1, I made the switch because spreadsheets are archaic.

Hoteliga,Hospitality Property Management Software,Stavros T.,,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Used the software for: Unspecified,“Everything you need plus the people you need”,"To start off: Yes, you need a channel manager. When I started this little hotel, people said that maybe investing in software was unnecessary (even if it did not cost much); I'd be able to cope just fine without it. Yes, I'd have coped; if I had only advertise through a single site. But the world and the internet are vast, and locking oneself out of a huge potential market and loyal guests is not a sound business move. And even if you limit your web-presence, what about returning guests who want to bypass the third party website and 15%+ commission those sites charge? If that wasn't enough, a good channel manager software will help you with your book keeping. Or at least hoteliga does. My accountant loves it. While other clients give bring her a folder of chaos, I have neat print-outs, allowing her to easily cross-reference all credit card charges, commissions due etc. The first time i came with my notes and explained, she did not pay too much attention, clients always talk and talk. The next time she asked: ""Did you bring..."" I grinned, of course I did. It takes less than a minute to do after all and makes me my accountant's favorite client. And everyone in a service orientated industry, as tourism is, quickly finds out that the interpersonal relationships are extremely important - just as you want to give the best to your clients and get those great ratings for your property, you also want to get the best out of the people you work with, and you can only achieve those things by being awesome yourself. Which brings us to perhaps the main point on why I am sitting here writing a 5/5 star review: the people. I could write that the hoteliga team has always been there when I needed them, which they have, but such a review could backfire - after all, you could then say ""I prefer a software where I wont need them in the first place."" So let me rephrase this: the hoteliga team has always been there, not just when I needed them, but also when I needed someone else. When there was a problem with a partner website advertising the property, the team was there to assist me with their knowledge of the industry. A guest left me a review saying ""On top of that there's Stavros, the host, that makes you feel welcome and taken care. "" I was grinning for a week. Well, now I am here to pass it on: ""Hoteliga is everything you as a hotel need, and on top of that you'll get Eva & co to support you in your business.""",-1,-1,Source: Capterra,"March 28, 2016",-1,-1,-1,-1,5,5,5,-1,-1,-1,,

We chose CLOCK PMS because of their Self Check-in Kiosk system. We are a Condo/Hotel and our office is open only during the day. Since installed, guests can check in any hour of the day SECURELY. Their ""partnerships"" with Assa Abloy (door locks and RFID key cards) and Adyen (credit card processing) make for a seamless experience for us and our guests. Also, the Web Reservation System works great with our website. Guests book online, pay their deposit or balance, and everything shows on their booking screen. I almost forgot to mention the support department. Everyone that I have worked with has gone above and beyond my expectations. Even though we are a US property, we still receive prompt response to our inquiries. They are great people!","Since we converted from a manual Excel based reservation system, we were unable to easily upload the guest information during set-up. Once we had our info in the proper format, the download into Clock was quick and easy. If you are converting from another PMS, you shouldn't experience this issue. The most time consuming part of set-up was setting up rates and rate plans. This was difficult at first, but once I got the hang of it - no problem. (thanks to help from support) Since we are not a conventional hotel , CLOCK PMS does not have every feature that I would have liked.

Since we take reservations in an other location than the hotel, CLOCK helps a lot to organize our work efficiently (there is no need to synchronization as the software is web-based). The software is easy to use, lean, reliable and has a very good cost/benefit (it's on a subscription basis, so you don't need to invest anything upfront). Another highlight are the interfaces to varios booking engines (such as booking.com, tripadvisor etc.), which automatically synchronizes our rates and availability with them. The best feature about CLOCK is the team behind, they listen to their customers and constantly improve their software. Many of our suggestions have been implemented at no cost in no time. The only downside of the system is the reliability of the internet. If the internet connection breaks down there is no way to access the information (but this point applies more to countries where internet connections are unstable; until now PMS and POS hasn't had any downtime). CLOCK PMS and POS are completely recommendable from small to bigger hotels and restaurants who are ready to implement a modern software that is completely online based.",-1,-1,Source: Capterra,"May 14, 2015",-1,-1,-1,-1,5,5,5,-1,-1,-1,,

Their knowledge and skill make the product work, but their sincere willingness to help us understand the program and customize it to our resort and their drive for customer service are what make the product work for us! We love the integration of the online system (IRM) with the same database that we pull from on our individual stations, so the two systems work seamlessly. Having the online system has increased our reservations dramatically, while allowing us to actually work with a smaller reservations staff. The individual property descriptions allow new guests and new staff to quickly see what each individual unit looks like, what is in the unit, where it's located, and what they can expect when they check in. The photos are easy for us to upload, and we can easily update descriptions as we change or upgrade our units. As the manager, I especially appreciate being able to customize reports to fit our needs. We can track demographics by city, state, or ZIP; we can run forecasts and stats on criteria we establish, and the data is easily transferred to both our Constant Contact and TripAdvisor databases. The service is outstanding. The process is very simple: you fill out a work order online. This allows you to define what your problem is, and their staff review it and assign both a technician and a time that is convenient for you to work on the problem together. Every time we work on an issue, it not only gets fixed, but the staff trains us so we can work more independently within the system. They are great at explaining the system, and their service is always prompt and professional. Most of our service calls fall in the nature of customizing reports, working through updates, and small tweaks. We know most of the staff by first name, and we feel that they know us. It's so much more efficient to work with people who know you, know what your goals are, and are willing to work hard to please you.","The only thing that bothered me was the amount of time involved in the initial setup, but that is something that is in all likelihood germane to the product. Regardless of whom you purchase a property management system from, you are just going to have to take pictures of all of your units, write property descriptions, and set up the rates. Ours was probably more detailed because we have 27 different floor plans (yes, I counted them just now!) and a three-tiered rate structure. Our units are each unique, so we couldn't standardize a picture of one unit and use it for several other units. We had to photograph and write descriptions and rates for almost 100 units.

The price changes promptly get broadcast to the listing sites. Communication with guests is simple. Payment is smooth too, in my bank on the day the guest arrives."," I was first attracted by the claim that I only needed to set up one listing and that would be broadcast to most of the popular listing sites around the globe. It saves a lot of time as now I do not have to setup and update of individual sites - I previously had seperate listings on HomeAway, TripAdvisor, AirBnB, OwnersDirect, etc. which took a lot of work and co-ordination. And best of all, there is only one calendar to keep updated! Even If do I forget, a helpful email jogs my memory every couple of weeks."," When first using the website I found that it did no seem to allow much flexibility to have different rates and charges however the site has developed over time and it is now easier to customise the pricing to suit your preference. The consequence is that it means you have to be very careful to read every bit of information before putting your listing online, otherwise you can get unpleasant surprises!

CiiRUS,Hospitality Property Management Software,Bill M.,VP Operations,"Hospitality, 1-10 employees",Hospitality,1-10 employees,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,“Failed Implementation - Know what you are buying”,"Overall it was an extremely expensive learning exercise for us. Their onboarding fee is quite high and I'm still not sure what we paid for. Basic implementation training can be achieved with their video training, they scrape the websites of existing bookings on HA to build properties, they use pretty basic templates for websites. As I said we were 5 weeks into implementation. Go Live Day we only had 1 channel semi operational. AirBnB and it was not collecting taxes correctly. TripAdvisor and Home Away followed about a week later but we learned what we thought was their responsibility was really our responsibility to work with the channels to get the changes done. Booking.com was never implemented and it represents 30% of our business so in reality I would say we never really were live. We had many software issue/problems and honestly I expected we would have some. It is software. It was very concerning though when core functionality just didn't seem to work correctly. They advertised on their website an integration with a smartlock company that didn't exist and of course it was the one that we needed. Automated payments weren't very automated... automated emails worked as long as the booking occurred prior to your automated send times otherwise you had to force them to go manually. We found that we were ultimately having to touch ever booking to post payments for AirBnB, to put in door lock codes, to make sure emails were sent and to resend etc.","We originally chose Ciirus because we were told they were fully integrated with the channels we did business with and they have features and functionality to support our electronic doorlocks, revenue management, housekeeping and guest portal. Unfortunately, we couldn't get it all working and after about 5 weeks of trying pulled the plug."," There are two versions of the software... the SAAS version that they call ONE and a Windows version. ONE supposedly is their go forward platform but it is difficult to use from a booking/reservation management standpoint and while the Windows version does a pretty good job for callin reservations it lacks all of the functionality of One. We found ourselves bouncing from screen to screen to find reservations and manage the components of the reservation that are needed. The user experience has you opening lots of different modules to be able to get details you need. Very disjointed. Guest communication is a big deal for us... SMS we never could get working and were told it only works with their CRM for automated messaging... you can't send an SMS on the fly if you needed to quickly reach out to a guest. None of the messaging is connected to the booking itself so you don't know what is scheduled to go out or what has been sent without jumping through hoops to get it. They have integrated the AirBnB messaging but again it is separate, not part of the booking and you have to jump to a different module and filter things to get what you need. Ask they why you have to use Mailchimp. Taxing for ABB does not work if you have ABB remit only a portion of the taxes and pass the remaining taxes onto the property manager to file. Booking.com has to have a very specific setup (if you use Group Home in Booking.com you will need to change) that we found at the last minute.",Source: Capterra,"November 18, 2020",-1," Full integration of all we needed (or so we thought) - Channel Management, PriceLabs, RemoteLock, native housekeeping module, native guest portal, integrated messaging, Authorize.net automated payments.

Bookinglayer,Hospitality Property Management Software,Anna B.,Administration,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Used the software for: Unspecified,“Bookinglayer experience since the beginning.”," We started with booking layer as one of the first. In general we are happy with booking layer. Of course, as with any system, there are advantages and disadvantages to it: Some advantages are: * Good customer management * Good overviews with regards to the bookings * Email templates to quickly answer your customers and save time * Really clear booking form and procedure, changed this year to meet the newest internet hypes etc. * Lots of options for payments and good control of payments * Allows you lots of detailed info about how your bookings are going compared to previous seasons. * Keeps being updated to the newest standards and is always developed further to meet the newest trends. (can also be a disadvantage of course as relatively frequent changes are made) * The owner is very helpful if there is a problem or if you are not happy with something, need a tailored solution etc. and tries to think with all of us to find the best solutions for us all. That already brings me to one of the disadvantages: * It is a product for many camps, therefore not everything might be the way you would do it if you would buy/make your own bookingssystem and there might be a few features which are not interesting to you (we, for instance, do not use the option to also plan the surflessons with it but still do that by hand, so have no experience with that). At the same time it might not be possible to implement some solutions which are important for you or the focus will be on something else at the time since you are the only one asking for it. * For us BL is not yet detailed enough when it comes to making bills. We still use a different system for that, as regulations in France are quite difficult. Therefore we still need other software for some solutions. Of course it is hard to say how that would be for you. Like I said, for us bookinglayer works well and it was definitely a good choice to start working with it. We are happy with it, however it is hard to say how it would tailor to your business. From our experience the owner is always happy to look at it together with you and will try to honestly tell you if his solution will be suited for you or not.",-1,-1,Source: Capterra,"October 26, 2015",-1,-1,-1,-1,4,4,5,-1,-1,-1,,

Hostfully Property Management Platform,Hospitality Property Management Software,Marco C.,Owner,"Real Estate, 1-10 employees",Real Estate,1-10 employees,Used the software for: 6-12 months,“One (sad) year using Orbirental”," One year ago I decided to betray my old and robust channel manager Wubook for Orbirental, attracted by its endless features list and the strong discount I was able to negotiate. A reliable channel manager MUST do real-time price changes and inventory updates, while managing hassle-free reservations modifications and deletions, and unfortunately Orbirental is very weak in all of that and doesn't manage reservations of multiple units at all (!) It has been a very frustrating year, full of anger, cursing, overbooking and, last but not least, a lot of time and money lost: a real nightmare. I have exchanged a huge amount of e-mail with tech support but none of their fixes showed stability: after a short time problems came back or new ones appeared. I have tried all of the features, like e-mail templates, webhook and API connectivity, and none is really reliable, everything is very buggy. SO, if your have one or two vacation properties and you want to play a little with a channel manager, maybe you can give Orbirental a try, but if you are running a serious accommodation business and time for your is money, I definitely recommend to look somewhere else."," The interface's graphics is nice, the calendar is easy to ready, the e-mail templates are useful.", Everything is buggy and totally unreliable.,Source: Capterra,"March 21, 2019",-1,-1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1,1,0/10,,

Originally discovered this as literally the only nice-looking solution for putting one's vacation rental calendar and a ""book now"" widget on a dedicated website, but then found it does so much more... Very helpful in terms of managing/consolidating leads from the many different listing platforms into one central location. The ability to easily send quotes to inquiring guests is fantastic. And, if you don't have a way to securely and directly take payments, well it gives you that, too (with support for many different payment processing and payment methods). It basically gives you all of the essential components you need to run a vacation rental business (and that you would have a very hard time hacking together yourself!). Essential for me was its ability to support dynamic pricing (currently from integration with PriceLabs) , but there should be more integrations as time goes on. My use case might be a little unusual as I own and manage just a single property. (I have no doubt that it easily scales to support even rather large property management firms and it was obviously designed from the ground up to support multiple users/agents and multiple properties.) For me, I was trying to build my own dedicated website for my vacation rental with similar features, functionality and user experience as delivered by Airbnb, VRBO, etc. and, lo and behold, using Orbirental gave me all of the pieces that I could not have easily and cost-effectively built myself. It can take a little time to understand the workflows and the Orbirental way of doing things (hence, 4 stars for ease-of-use), but it's mighty powerful... And I find myself, over time, moving toward making it more central to the way I manage and respond to guest inquiries (which I probably should have done in the first place). OUTSTANDING customer support with quick response time, a ""there are no stupid questions"" attitude, and very responsive to requests for enhancement. Very reliable: The only ""issues"" I've seen with the product have been due to the general complexities of integration with the broad variety of external data feeds they have to deal with (e.g., something goes haywire at Airbnb or HomeAway and that ends up affecting Orbirental).

The Hostfully team members I have come in contact with have all showed me a unique desire to deliver a robust solution to the day to day struggles I deal with as a property manager. I have used 3 other ""top rated"" alternative property management solutions and they all fall flat and short. When I say I recommend ""them""...Hostfully...I say that because you are not just getting software...you are getting a team dedicated to making their customers user experience a successful one!

Unfortunately I have not been able to fully explore it, nor sign up officially, as the company is not as straightforward and easy to use as the software appears to be."," In order to evaluate this pms you have to sign up for a `free two-week trial AND supply your card details. As a rule, I would avoid a company that does this but they have all these great reviews and so, against my better judgment, I went ahead. I expected that there would be an email reminder that the trial was coming to an end - not an unreasonable expectation but sadly it is. I received no reminder that the two-week trial was coming to an end and that I would be charged. No notification nor receipt when they made TWO separate charges to my card. Two charges because apparently, I upgraded my account by asking to see a feature not visible on the trial account, and which was activated, not by me. Glitches happen and I thought this could be sorted out. Again, I was wrong. Instead, I received a schlock response about how everything is automated and it is up to the `user to sign up and also to cancel. So, if the software is so well automated - why can it not send emails notifying a `free trial has ended and charges have been levied? I was never able to speak to a real person.

The BE The booking engine's design is easy to use for customers. The Rezstream team did a great job matching the look of my website making the transition between the pages seamless. The Cloud Interface My wife and I run a small cabin business. Like many couples, we compliment each other with different skills. I'm the tech guy and she's the friendly face of the business. She's not tech-savvy at all and when I mentioned migrating from Rezstream's old software to the cloud there was the obvious resistance to change. That all disappeared within minutes of watching me navigate through the new software on day 1. The layout of user interface is so intuitive that my wife was comfortable with the Rezstream's cloud system within a few hours. Customer Service I truly believe that Rezstream has the best support team I've ever come across. James, Kyle & Wendy have all helped me along the way and I can tell that each of them care about the product and the customer. They take the time to listen to every concern and they do an unparalleled job of researching problems as well as explaining and/or teaching solutions. I also know there are some phenomenal code guys in the background. They're getting it done! Noticeable Improvements Gaining accessibility to our guest database through the Cloud PMS has been a lavish luxury. No more are we tied to a specific computer tied to a specific location. I can review the calendar and move reservations from my phone. I can access guest contact information from my office across town. I can make changes to my rate plan from my house. It is a game changer. Scheduled emails automate so many of our most mundane guest correspondence tasks. Automatically triggering events like thank you emails have immediately driven up our positive reviews on travel sites. Credit card processing has never been easier for us with this new version of the software. The pairing with Shift4 and Rezstream's new procedures in the user interface have made the collection process significantly more efficient than anything we've tried before.

There's no extra BS that isn't useful or doesn't work, so it does what it does extremely well. When I started into short term rentals in 2016, Uplisting was newer and I ultimately chose a different product that had been around much longer and was more feature rich. However, it became a headache to use, was slow, buggy, and poorly conceived. I switched to a second product, then a third and experienced the same issues -- software bloat, an unintuitive interface, and a glacially slow development process where even critical bugs could take weeks or longer to sort out, and promised features routinely wound up months to even years behind. Finally I rediscovered Uplisting. Since I first looked at their product, it's grown faster than nearly any other competitor in the market. The team answers questions comprehensively and immediately, bug fixes or small feature additions seemingly happen overnight, and large features roll out on a bi-weekly to monthly basis. This is absolutely fantastic. I needed automated reviews, automated messaging, API integration to VRBO/ABB/Booking, a useable app or mobile friendly web site, integration with dynamic pricing, and a direct booking platform.

Overall I find the system difficult to use with an old, unintuitive interface. In spite of what I thought originally it is also very expensive because one is required to use an intermediary to process all third party bookings, such as Expedia and Booking.com, and they charge a percentage for every booking (in addition to the regular commission). The interface, which is a series of popup boxes that have to be closed at every stage before moving forward, is a design that is at least twenty years old. It is time consuming and unintuitive. The system hard to grasp and to use properly. The night audit - which users are forced to process manually every day - is confusing, and we often found ourselves clicking through just to be able to move on, even though this meant we had incorrect data. The reports are poorly designed. I was first pleased with the idea that there was no charge for online bookings, but this has now changed because of the new Web book module. There are many small inconveniences that reflect a low concern for customers needs. The company charges numerous high fees for unexpected reasons: for example, for training tutorials, to view the training webcasts offline, to purchase an additional copy of the training manual, to reset a password if it is entered incorrectly too many times, and a limited number of questions you can ask even if you have a service contract - additional questions, even for minor issues, are expensive. roomMaster is a professional system with lots of checks and balances to confirm that entries are made correctly.

We must be gluttons for punishment because Opera V5 is the 3rd Micros PMS product we have used. It will certainly be the last. The first product was a disaster for the users and ultimately the company because it was discontinued after three years. We were then given a very good monetary incentive to switch to Opera V4 which was okay but didn't offer some features we would have liked and the customer service was bad. An upgrade was needed when Micros was purchased by Oracle. We chose this time to upgrade our online reservations and upon the advice of our sales rep we switched from the free MyFidelio to WebHotel which would have a monthly fee but was supposedly worth this, as it was customizable. This turned out to be very untrue. It was basically an out of the box with only a few customizable features, not to mention that the configuration was cumbersome and not guest friendly at all and was ugly, obviously designed by technicians with no input from graphic designers. We spent much money redesigning everything we could to make the look and feel match our property's look and make the guest experience more user friendly. I must say that the technician we worked with has been the most responsive and accommodating Micros employee we have dealt with over the past many years. Anyway, I am getting off track. Since upgrading to V5 more than one year ago, quite a few things we contracted and paid for have not functioned or been installed i.e., Chip Card processing integration, HTL forms, guest phone call integration to folios to name a few and yet, we receive hate mail from Oracle's accounting dept. monthly asking for more money for services never received.

Initially the software wasn't great (we didn't find out until after we had been promised access from tablets and mobile devices that it was a Java program that won't run on anything except Windows Explorer) and the training was definitely sub-par, however, Micros at least had decent support and you didn't wait at least half an hour to talk to a support rep. Once Oracle took over it went from mediocre to absolute torture. The platform is slow, the customer service is abysmal (they always tell you they can't help you because it's hosted and the hosting team will need to look at it and they never get back to you) and features we initially paid for are no longer accessible because Oracle decided they weren't completely secure on their hosted platform and rather than fix the problem they just disabled functionality altogether. We have literally had support tickets open for months and some portion of the system goes offline at least once a month. On top of all this, they want to nickel and dime you for everything. They literally don't allow you to edit your own forms but they are happy to charge you to edit them, meanwhile you are paying a fortune for the platform and for nonexistent support. For 2017 my primary goal is to get both our hotels off the platform and we will never use another Oracle product again.

At the very beginning of my career in hospitality I started off with one of the earliest versions of Opera, which at that time was already way ahead from its pears, at a time when not many software companies cared much about hospitality applications. It was simply way above anything else available and twice better than the close competitor. For a few years, having changed companies in between I've used several PMS system, however all were really bad and difficult to use. I remember Marriott still running their PMS, which was DOS based and worked by remembering all the codes, the mouse was an optional on the PC. Having returned to Europe and another chain, Opera - Oracle PMS was there. Simply, thanks God. Took me a day to get to learn the new functionalities and I was back into the game. The newcomers in my team were trained super fast as it is a very easy PMS to learn and implement. I remember the whole team going through training sessions in one of the hotels as were were changing PMS and everyone learned the system so quickly, even managed to train a guy covering a shift (coming from a different hotel without Opera) to use it in 2 hours and spend the whole evening shift alone, it went without problems.

We pleasantly declined and wanted to warn potential customers from wasting their money and time on false promises., The product simply does not function and causes more errors in your reportings. There are no Pro due to this.,"1) Owners Report- Does not work. The system can not give you the basics, ask them to show you a Room Revenue for a single property from Airbnb, Booking.com and Expedia- It does not happen. Don't fall for the demo report ask them to show it live. Their solution to us was to manually adjust the entries in the system to get a correct report for owners. Do not also believe that it will be upgraded, in 15 months we worked with them it did not get done. 2) In the reporting the date format is reported as a text and not as dates and the system does not give you number off nights stayed. 3) Everything you ask them costs 150 pounds to get an answer. If you want to see how their API works they will charge you, if you want to have a conversations with them on developing some thing before the conversation they will charge you. 4) Do not do the website with them, they use outdated tools and then start charging you extra to do upgrades. In 12 months we could not get a client to get to the final reservation page on the website cause of their coding. 5) No consistency in their software, when you print reports in some reports the property comes up as a descriptions, in others as a short code in others a full name. Despite several requests this never got done. 6) Very complicated to add customers, owners and suppliers. 7) Not many partners want to work with them cause of their approach.

I now rarely have to get involved with this process. - Ability to specify arrival/depart days, min/max length of stay (my standard set-up), & then open up a cottage for e.g. a much shorter-stay, or a `non-standard arrival day, to fill any gaps. - Integration with Staah, so a 2 way integration with many appropriate OTAs - Slick customer-facing booking-engine gives a clear booking process. Branded to look like my own website, including URL (with SSL certification). - Very flexible & easy to use promotions tool. - `Guest Lounge is also a great feature and should be a real USP, as many providers don't offer this. Has contributed to making compliance with GDPR easy, as guests can view their personal data held. - Continually upgrading & revitalising system, which is very reassuring. - Customer service I know it has been said in previous reviews, the support has been fantastic. Good (although could be better) user guides and how-to videos also."," - Would be good to have a mobile-responsive system, so that working off-site on an iPad, or iPhone is easier. - The back-end property management system is looking a little dated and therefore doesn't reflect/promote the quality of the excellent functionality - Lots of clicking between screens when making a reservation manually - Marketing tool is not as swish as it could be.

GraceSoft Easy InnKeeping,Hospitality Property Management Software,Conrad M.,Owner,Unspecified,Unspecified,Unspecified,Used the software for: Unspecified,"“As a standalone it's pretty good BUT if you connect to Expedia, beware!”","I've been on this for about 5 months now and it was a toss up between WebRezPro, and I'm wondering if I should have gone with the latter. Neither company could convert my data from Rezovation besides the customer table, so I lost a decade of history. I went with Easy Innkeeping because they had the ability to set up a different child/adult extra person rate. It's amazing how many software packages don't. The Easy Innkeeping refresh rate is annoyingly slow, I just expect it to be less than a second. I also don't like that they maintain their own hardware, I would rather they put it on Amazon or Google's server farm, like Clock PMS. They don't charge for bookings over their own system, but $3 for reservations which come through Expedia. The main problem is that data doesn't come over right. The entire amount shows up in the daily rate, no tax or other items, so I have to re-enter it. And I've asked numerous times. And, get this, if you want to set up a minimum stay on weekends, you have to create a separate seasonal rate for every weekend! if you have a Bnb like me, this is not the software you want. They were able to update it via a script on the back end, but it's such an easy thing to code for since they already have a way to apply a rate to the days of the week, it should be just a matter of checking off a box where you want to apply the minimum nights. Tech support is mostly by chat, their little window will pop up saying 'approximate wait time is one minute'....I've gotten that message and waited 20 minutes without result. They are constantly improving the software, and uptime has been very good. They run on top of some other software so that when an employee logs in, their password displays in the open in the URL for a second or two. WTF, you may ask? Well, yes, so if you're worried about your employees hacking into another person's account, this software isn't for you either. Oh, I paid a year in advance, and for 2 months haven't had time to verify the expedia bookings were correct, so they cut off my access to the software even though I paid for a year, over a $30 past due bill. And they cut it off at night, when they don't have anyone available to take a payment.

The simple reason for this choice is because their people actually care. You can pick up the phone and speak to a real person within seconds. If you have done something stupid and need help - they will help you. If the system is lacking a feature you require - they will beta test it and consider you. The system integrates pretty well with our Datasym Epos system (a few The software is browser friendly, tablet friendly and surprisingly you are able to do most functions on a phone - normally a feature of only basic systems. The interface is pleasing to the eye. Easy to navigate. A few mods could be done to make the booking process foolproof (again, in development i believe). I wish that sometimes updates would come sooner but these guys have probably learned the hard way about what happens if you rush through something. I also wish that Admins had more control and could restrict access for others and personalise the system to shape their business more. Saying this, I believe that these are all in the pipeline already. The system is very good value for money.

I should bill them for my wasted time.," It sounded good before I actually started using it. It has all the features we need. All the channels, automation, website, calendar sync.","- SLOW CALENDAR SYNC - They told me the calendar sync was instant. That's true but only coming from Airbnb. I blocked off dates in MyVR and 40 minutes later got an Airbnb booking for those dates. Then they admitted that it take 45 minutes to sync from MyVR to Airbnb. I was double booked right away. - I paid for their training package which took a lot longer then expected to complete. Several months in fact. During this time, they were also charging the monthly cost for use of the service that I wasn't even using yet. Eventually they refunded this portion but only after several requests. - Support slow and often useless. There is no way to talk to a human. I sent several emails asking for help with double bookings and they would not call me. It took them several days to respond and they asked clarifying questions that only proved they didn't even read my email and had no idea what the problem was. - Pricey training is a joke. It was sold to me as a one-on-one coaching to get me set up quickly. Basically instead of watching generic videos that may or may not apply to your situation, it is a live person running through generic videos and training that may or not apply to you. They also sent me outdated instructions that got me lost. Total waste of countless hours. Finally I insisted the last part of training be done over a zoom online meeting, which i initiated.

It sounds superficial, but If I have to look at this software every day, sometimes for hours in a day while I am working, I would rather it not hurt my eyes! MyVR doesn't. It's beautiful, simple, and pleasant to work in. It's also surprisingly user friendly. True, as MyVR adds more features the software does become more complicated, and sometimes I can't find a certain feature until I ask support, but these features are not buried within hidden recesses of the software. When using MyVR I feel like everything is at my fingertips - I can find the features I need, and I can use them with very little difficulty. I especially love the website building features. MyVR offers a great blend of structure and flexibility, giving me lots of options for customizing our website, while still providing enough boundaries that I don't wreck our site with my limited knowledge of html, css, or other website intricacies. The drag and drop web builder makes it super easy to build a beautiful site, but I still have the power to create and change redirects, customize my SEO, and insert custom html. I love it. And did I mention the interface is pleasant to look at? Yeah, I love that. I don't use the reservations and lead management side of MyVR as much, so I am not as familiar with those parts of the software, but as far as listing properties and building a website, I love it. I'm looking forward to exploring more of their integration options to possibly push our property data out to Flipkey. MyVR is not 100% perfect - no software is - and it does have some limitations, but one of the things that I love about MyVR is that they are constantly adding new features, fixing bugs, and figuring out better ways to do things. When I contact MyVR support I know that I will either get help, or that their tech people will work on fixing the bug I found. I feel like, in working with MyVR, I am working with real people, people who care about their product and who honestly want me to like it rather than forcing us into some strange and convoluted software system.

Not only do I have a professional website, but I can accept credit card payments and keep track of all my reservations too. The best part is how quickly I was able to get my vacation rental business up and running. It's definitely NOT a one size fits all, though. I have the ability to customize my settings according to my preferences. MyVR has a several different options including the ability to take online payments, send out auto-responders with my own email templates, add attachments to emails, as well as integrate my website with Homeway/VRBO and Flipkey. Since my website is integrated with those websites, I don't have to maintain those listings. My calendar, photos and property description automatically sync with both sites. The website design process was super easy, but the results are amazing! I was able to modify my template design with several drag and drop options. This enabled me to add videos and other features to make my website stand out. I also love that it is mobile friendly too. I was not impressed with many of the competitors' options. None of them had the awe factor that I was able to get with MyVR. I also loved that I was able to build a Facebook page for my rental business very quickly and easily with a just a few clicks. The calendar feature gives me a quick glance at my reservations and availability, plus I have the option to see my inquiries too. This has been helpful when I need to follow-up with potential renters. When I receive an inquiry, I can quickly generate a quote along with a payment link and a copy of my rental agreement. I also added on an instant quote feature to my website so renters can obtain a quick estimate, too. I did some lengthy research before I made my decision and it was quite apparent to me that MyVR stood out. They offer everything I need to successfully market and manage my vacation rental.

We manage about 20 properties per year in the Healdsburg area, the `heart' of northern California's wine country, and after all my research, MyVR was the clear best choice. Even the web designer who gave me the estimate for a custom site commented that for him to do the programming on the back side could cost another $5,000.00 if he could even replicate what MyVR had created. We are particularly happy with the partnership that MyVR has with Trip Advisor's Flipkey, VRBO, and Airbnb for hourly calendar updates and daily photo and copy change updates. We are also just starting to explore the very diverse and relevant options that the MyVR program offers with the additional benefit of updates as the process continues to evolve.

Booking Automation continuously landed in the top spot for ease of use, technical support, and cost for features. With their well documented API we were able to easily integrate the 2 platforms (theirs and ours) together allowing our clients to seamlessly upload and download new reservations as well as providing financial reports, triggered emails, channel management and much more. Probably the feature that we were most amazed with was the click and drag interface for moving existing reservations around.

Whilst it is an easy program to use, it still needs some work to make it a successful program across the board."," The program is easy to use especially for training new staff. We love the credit card feature and how easy it is to pop the credit card in and charge the card the card without manually using an eftpos machine. Entering rates has never been more easier, we love the the tabs along the bottom to show for outstanding balances etc. Visually the program is easy on the eyes. Simple program good for very small properties. Not sure how it would go on a large hotel. I like the idea of the revenue reports, however this would only be functional if accounted for is accurate entered through.","The program lacks a few simple features and functions. We don't like the check out process for a guest departure. When you click the checkout button (even when no money is owing on the profile) it takes you into the guest folio, you then have to go to the home tab and go through the pointless screen slide. A bit time consuming. 2. There is no where to set up a group master to add a payment too. There is way to much room for error for direct deposits to not be accounted for correctly or invoicing the incorrect people. The reconcile report can not show you if money has not been accounted for some where. It just shows that a button has been clicked and its shown up on a report. It is all to easy to clear a profile and void a profile for money to become easily untraceable. Simple functions for setting up groups (e.g. school groups, travel agents) can apparently only be done through Xero to apply payments and then to cash a guest profile off in preno you select relevant sub heading... If not set up correctly money is accounted for incorrectly and in our case untraceable from previous employees misuse. You need to stay on top of all transactions daily going back and forth between too many avenues. This is not a one stop shop program. A bed selection tab on the guests profile would be so handy the current way is harder to use, especially when converting to the housekeeping report.

This is an invaluable tool for us - it has saved my organization so much time and effort by making sure our clients know exactly what to expect when they walk in day-of. Our clients will come to our event planning meetings with ideas that are creative, but aren't necessarily appropriate for our unique space. After our event-planning meetings, Social Tables allows us the chance to give our clients an exact representation of the capabilities of our space. This can help not only to show the client our knowledge of what will work best in the space, but also to discourage a stubborn client from insisting on a ""bad idea."" The client will walk into our space the day of their event knowing exactly what they will get. I work primarily with a student-based staff...

First, they need to make it so they can just upload the DWG or other CAD floorplans directly into the system because their way of tracing over the PDF extracted leaves a lot of room for errors in the measurements. Second, they need to make it so heights can be rendered properly (which would be fixed by the previous suggestion) because the 3D view is almost useless due to this in a lot of spaces.

I miss not talking to support with a script or in another country, as well as the really personal onboarding I got when I was in my old building and implemented the software for the first time.

Gearco,Hospitality Property Management Software,Jonah L.,Owner,"Hospitality, 11-50 employees",Hospitality,11-50 employees,Used the software for: 6-12 months,“Gearco is easily the GREATEST PMS for extended stay hotels and motels”," A year ago I was trying desperately to find a new PMS. I was using Little Hotelier at the time and they were too expensive, hard to use, and lacked tons of features. I tried many different software and they all kind of sucked, but eventually, I found Gearco and it has improved by business dramatically. Many people may not hear about them as they are a small company, but they really deliver. I talked to the [SENSITIVE CONTENT] on the phone and they gave me a price that was far below any of the competitors. They even sent someone out all the way to Idaho to walk me through the software. Their support has been unbeatable, and [SENSITIVE CONTENT] at Gearco goes out of her way to make sure you are taken care of promptly. What other company lets you call whenever you want a talented agent that handles anything you need? Since using Gearco on my one hotel, we have purchased several others, and Gearco was there to help me get set up at every one of them. They made the process easy and I've been so happy to find a PMS that doesn't suck.","-Cost. Gearco is less expensive than ANY other PMS I've looked into, despite it being way better. -Support. The support from Gearco is phenomenal. [SENSITIVE CONTENT] in particular is fantastic. I have her phone number and can reach out at any time with questions or updates and she gets them done pronto. All of the support is here in the US. I've never had such great support from a software company. -Functionality. I could talk for days about this. It is so much easier and more robust than other PMS. You can easily see all your rooms, their check outs, who owes what etc. and it is all on a grid that reminds me of Excel. You can quickly pull up guest information, store credit cards, and do whatever you'd want to do on a hotel PMS. -Integration. It integrates easily with our card terminal. I highly recommend the card terminal. It auto updates when people make card payments etc. You can have guests sign your contract on the card terminal and it also stores that file on their Gearco profile. You can also scan driver license's into the system and it auto updates the guest's information. You can also integrate with Expedia etc. but I've never used that feature. -Multiple properties. I have 4 properties through Gearco and it is super easy to switch between them and see how everything is going. -No Commitment. There is no contract with Gearco and you can cancel at anytime (I don't know why you would though!)","Compared to other PMS out there (trust me I tried several), Gearco beats them hands down. My only cons would be nit picky things. I don't like how it makes you re log in twice and makes you re log in if you have been inactive for 15 minutes, but I get why they have that for security reasons. It would nice if that was an option in the system to disable that though.",Source: Capterra,"September 9, 2021",-1,-1," I was using Little Hotelier for a year and honestly was not happy with them.

It is also a robust software in my opinion and provides the necessary functions in an easy to use format. We went from 'zero' to 'hero' in no time using this software for the first time back when we opened our first Best Western Plus property in 2019. I was in touch with [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN] the Implementation Coordinator over at Visual Matrix who helped us set up the software for our new property just a couple of months back. [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN] is courteous and very knowledgeable about the product he offers. He always took the time to answer my numerous questions and was always willing to explain the set up procedure every step of the way. He also helped coordinate other stakeholders. He really did go above and beyond and made the sign up process very easy. I must also applaud the Visual Matrix Technical Support team. They are also very responsive and willing to help each time we call in with any query. If an agent doesn't quite have the right answers to your questions, they politely ask if they can put you on hold and go in search of someone else who can help out. Keep up the good work guys!"," It is quite easy to get around Visual Matrix. Each function is also easy to locate. The most impactful for me is the Front Office/Reservations function. I just like the way all the options are laid out at the top of the screen making navigation very easy and seamless. We take calls each day from guests wanting to book rooms and find out availability. You'll agree with me that there is the need to have a program that gives you the power to move from one screen to the other with the smallest number of mouse clicks. Visual Matrix integration with our existing business processes has been quite easy I must say. For instance, I have the power to work off two instances of the program simultaneously. This comes in pretty handy if I ever need to provide a guest with information without interrupting what I was doing on the first page. Now this is flexibility!"," Lately, there has been the need for us to post voucher pre-payments for guests who haven't quite booked their stays yet on Visual Matrix. It has been quite a challenge handling such pre-payments on Visual Matrix and the question for me has been where to post such payments given that there is no booking to attach it to. I would appreciate it very much if the necessary function that would allow us to do this could be introduced.

Of the two, I strongly preferred Maestro. I've used Maestro as a front desk agent, night auditor, front office manager, and general manager. Once past the learning curve, and with repeated use, you can fly through the program quicker than the computer can refresh... at least I could :)","Once you get past the learning curve, it's very easy to use and move quickly through the program. It is a great program for all aspects of managing hotel be it inventory and rate management, guest management, reservations, sales, accounting. I'm sure in 7 years I've used it, I didn't get to use every function since there was just so much. What I liked most was that it is quick and easy to access a lot of information (guest, company, or group info or history / room availability and pricing / accounting and sales figures). This was very helpful since easy flow of information is vital to a hotel running smoothly. When loading rates, I particularly liked that I could set automatic rate adjustments base on parameters such as dates, day of the week, occupancy, room type, or a combination of any of the aforementioned. This automation meant that if sudden inventory changes occurred on the rare occasion that I was not working, the rates would increase or decrease to achieve the best average daily rate and occupancy. Managing inventory was very easy with Maestro. Even with 9 different room types, I could use various reports to see overall occupancy, occupancy by room types, and also by specific rooms. I could go on. It is a very solid PMS program and I would use it again."," The only real dislike that I had with this program was the learning curve. Because the particular Maestro PMS we used was easier to use without using a computer mouse, it was essential to learn the mnemonics (ALT- letter combo) of every function. I still remember that to get to reservations was ALT-I-R. This was was complicated by the fact that sometimes the ALT-letter combo varied between different tasks even though they were similar tasks. The best way to explain is an example: In a guest reservation, to access notes I would key in ALT-I-N, in a group reservation, I would have to key in ALT-I-T.",Source: Capterra,"February 18, 2019",-1,-1,-1,-1,4,3,-1,4,-1,8/10,,

The credit card situation is the biggest problem and requested GP to allow another credit card processor to write an interface (replacing NMI) and were told ""they will not do it and have no plans to do it"". This is even after their tech support people agreed that NMI's method of settlement does not work properly for the hospitality industry. Finally, the customer support team does not advise other customers if a problem occurs on their software. We had a problem where the on-line booking allowed a customer to book a room, pay nothing, and get a confirmation saying ""PAID IN FULL"" even though no payment was made. After it was fixed for us, we contacted other users who unknowingly had the same issue but were never told about it and it was still working improperly.

Before using GuestPoint, we were using an older DOS based software. We moved to GuestPoint a few years ago because we wanted an easier system to use, that also integrated web booking functionality. It was the right choice for us. GuestPoint is very easy to use, and it laid out very logically. We have found Centium to be very responsive to the users, taking their input very seriously and using it to constantly improve it. Implementation was fast and easy, and the Centium staff was there all the way. Getting used to dealing with a new system is always an adjustment, but in the case of GuestPoint it will be a switch you will be very glad you made. In fact, you will probably kick yourself for not making the switch sooner, I know I did! If you are anything like us, GuestPoint will make a world of difference in running your property.

GuestPoint,Hospitality Property Management Software,Jason K.,Owner,"Hospitality, 11-50 employees",Hospitality,11-50 employees,Used the software for: 1-2 years,“Don't go near Guest Point unless you want double bookings”,"Apart from the above issues and the major fault (#1), Guest Point would of been a great PMS which I would of recommended to others. Unfortunately the update time between Guest Point and your channel manager ruins the whole system because it makes it a liability for your property. I wouldn't normally leave a bad review on a company however the fact we first mentioned this fault over 12 months again, you can never get a hold of anyone, no one ever gets back to you from their company makes it obvious their staff don't actually care and Centium Software is more focused on their Event Air software rather the Guest Point."," Has many good features that other PMS don't have. Property dashboard is a good idea, Management Tab is relatively easy to set up although some features weren't thought out very well like the promotions feature which could of been structured better to manage contracts. Accounts Management is really good, no complaints here over the functionality of the department. Customer Management is easy to manage and access data however again not thought out very well. The reservations calendar is visually good although takes getting use to, Guest Point has many good features other PMS's don't have however also has many annoying things which make it obvious it was designed by developers rather than them seeking advice for people in the industry.","#1 fault with Guest Point which is why I wouldn't recommend it to other operators is it is the only PMS on the market who don't update availability to your channel manager on a regular basis. Most PMS I've dealt with in the past update your availability to your online platforms every 30-60 sec, Guest Point can take up to 10-20 mins before to sends an update to your channel manager. Also it can often take up to 10-20 minutes before an online reservation appears on your booking Calendar, not good if that was you last room and someone books it over the phone before the online booking appears. On top of that, beyond 3 months out from your current date they will only update your channel manager once a day. If you take a reservation over the phone 6 months out it will often be still bookable for over 12 hours online before Guest Point send an update to your channel manager. The staff at Guest Point don't seem to care about how big of an issue that is risking their customers reputations with double bookings as I first made them aware of this fault over 12 months ago and they still have no valid answers. All I have got out of them is them blaming the channel managers however after investigating multiple PMS and Channel Managers I discovered this is not true. Despite all the good features which would actual make Guest Point a great system to recommend this one fault is the #1 reason I would warn people away from Guest Point unless you like double bookings. #2 Support - Support if often difficult to get a hold of. Most modern systems have an online support portal to communicate through however with Guest Point you have to phone first. The majority of the time you get a hold of someone in their admin which can't help with an issue but schedules a ticket where a support team member will call back. Typically it takes a few hours before anyone contacts you. #3 Customer Tab - Gathering, storing and accessing guest information is great however customer/ individual records can't be linked to a company. When your making a booking it would of been great when you select said company that a list of all the employees or individuals in that company appear. This just makes it awkward when a regular books and you can't remember his name and or the company name so a feature like this would of been nice. #4 Reservations - Reservations are pretty simple to make however again their are a number of things the developers didn't think through properly. For example if your on the phone with a travel agent who wants you to book 4 rooms. You could book all 4 rooms at the same time however if they have different Purchase Orders you have to do them individually and then you don't have a record of which reservations are associated with each other. Also, you can't link reservations after they have been made, if you want them to be linked then you have to delete the reservations and start again which is just annoying.",Source: SoftwareAdvice,"November 17, 2018",-1,-1,-1,-1,2,4,1,2,3,1/10,,

The colour coded reservation plan is very easy to read and see your occupancy/availability at a glance. Making bookings is simple and we have found the automated emails and text messages a great marketing tool (and we've received lots of compliments from the customers too about the ""Personal emails and texts""). There are a myriad of reports you can run - all the ones you would normally expect in a PMS, as well as extras such as which of your regular customers haven't stayed in a little while. We often use this to follow up and see what they're up to. Our absolute favourite feature though would have to be the ""dashboard"".

This was a huge project for us to embark on having to move bookings, payments, users, fifty properties etc , from 2 systems to one. It was (as expected), a very bumpy road for us at the start. It was difficult to grasp the method in which Genkan collates & processes information entered at setup level , and how this is applied later on at a working / operational level and in sync with how our booking agency operates. Two months down the track and we are loving it! It has been fantastic having the reservations and trust accounting all in the one spot. We can now appreciate the difficult setup time and how this enables the system to work seamlessly. Alot of our processes are now automated which is FANTASTIC! We may be looking at taking some more properties on our portfolio as a result of this. It may be to too soon to tell, but at this stage we think the system (and new Genkan website that came with it) may be generating more bookings for us. We had a training mananger that trained us each week for about six weeks which was invaluable. If we did this again with the knowledge that we have now, I would suggest to Genkan that they set out to gain more information on the new client in how the agency is setup etc and perhaps have their development team do some of the setting up as part of the overall service. Although we are somewhat technically savvy- I would think that for those who are not, the setup could become daunting without the adequate support",-1,-1,Source: Capterra,"September 1, 2015",-1,-1,-1,-1,4,4,4,-1,-1,-1,,

As this is a very different business model to hotels, Bed and Breakfast, motels or holiday parks...there was nothing on the market that ticked all the boxes for individual property owners, housekeeping management, maintenance management, bookings, automation of communication, and most importantly ACCOUNTS!! All other PMS software on the market seemed to be real estate based, or hotel based, but nothing that sung out for all aspects of our industry of Holiday Home Accommodation. I have only just scratched the surface with the available functionality with this programme, so I am looking at the growth ahead with some great relief, in the knowledge that both the system and my business will evolve together. The only thing that I personally would have loved to have from the system is a printable manual (or a separate disk) so that during the learning and setup stage I could have had a reference manual 'on hand' which took me step by step through the process of getting set up and up and running. I found that by having youtube video, help button, messenger, and phone support all a bit disjointed for 'me'. and confusing as some of the 'help button' information was out of date or not there (obviously functionality has been added along the way but not all the 'help' added with it)......some others may have found that the process of setup and training easier, but for me (as I work alone) I found it hard.

It needs to be easy to use and easy to administer. Seekom ticks some boxes - cloud based, reports - but missed the mark on easy to administer. Seekom makes a typical engineering focused mistake of aiming to deliver flexibility through complication. Overall I find the strengths really pleasing and the weaknesses infuriating.", The cloud based access is excellent and the primary reason I haven't returned to my old system - Campground master. As the business owner I can easily access the system from anywhere in the world to support our managers. The payment gateways work well and some of the standard reports are very good for end of the month purposes and real time revenue tracking. As long as you don't want to change anything in your set up it is not too cumbersome for a new person to use.," The user experience is extremely frustration for an administrator and is one of the least intuitive systems I have come across for administrative purposes. The process of making simple changes can be highly complicated and follows a logic that is only obvious to the the engineers that wrote the code. The help section is not much better and is written for an audience that is already deeply intimate with the system. It becomes a little better after you invest hours into getting into their mindset.

Specifically, they have provided a screen for charging a stored card where it is not possible to store a Merchant Reference for onward transmission to Payment Express (despite appearing to do so!); they have not recognised a Merchant Reference can be important to the service provider for all sorts of reasons - in our case, bank reconciliations. Also, they have failed to recognise that, with luck and a bit of effort, guests return! The service provider will wish to avoid asking for card details each time they enter a booking. Currently, there is no way of linking to a card stored within Payment Express under that guest's name.

I don't believe this was any fault of the speaker, I think it was just a bad mic that recorded poorly and about it that made it concentrate on the content. Adding subtitles so people could watch without sound might help. Or just update the voice over with better sound quality. While it plays well with divi, i did struggle in the initial set up because I had to customize the shortcodes often for it to display exactly how I wanted ad that kinda makes the whole divi extension purposeless. While it is made for a much bigger hotel set up downsizing had a bit more of a learning curve for me.

The implementation and deployment of the system is successful delivering significant improvement in the maintenance management."," Software is very easy to use and is built with screen similar to webpages. Elements on pages are hyperlinked to other functions /modules and moving between different modules is very easy and simple. The workflows are simple and customizable. The interfaces / pages are simple and only show the information that is required to do the work thus not overwhelming the user. The team is very capable and is able to customize the solution as per the requirements form us. I have worked with multiple implementations of different software within supply chain, I found Aladdin team as one of the best that I have worked with. Their ability to understand the requirement and implement is commendable. One such example is the scheduling module, which easily stands out vs any other software that were evaluated. The module shows the information related to the availability of resources based on their work schedule and already assigned work. It has drag and drop interface to schedule the workorder, there is color coding to show overbooking and out of normal working time assignment to resources. The ease of access of records is also a feature I would like to highlight. From within assets module one can see the history of the work that has been done in the past, each record is a hyperlink which can take to the details of the work order. These are examples, there is much more to the software which is not possible to cover in this short review.", The preventive maintenance module can be improved further. Although it fulfils the basic requirements however the workflow can be improved further.

This costs us a lot of time and money considering all the mistakes that were made. RoomRaccoon is developed in cooperation by small hotels and they do understand the difference in requirements between a larger and a smaller hotel. It is very flexible and there are no extra costs involved. When I contacted them they set up a fully functional demo for me pre-filled with my rooms, rates and package deals (must have taken them some time :)). This made understanding the system and using is right away was very easy. Important to me is also that I can manage everything myself without having to pay a developer or sign a service contract. There are many features just made for small hotels. The overview of your reservations, for instance, is much bigger and contains more information about the reservation. Further, it offers an integrated channel manager (yes, included in the 95,- Euro) and the commission free booking engine just looks great (on all devices). Now, we do not have to make a single invoice in Excel any longer. It simply is a matter of hitting the print button! What a change... I also like a lot that they take any suggestion to the system very serious. It is still a new system but it is already probably the best out there for a small hotels such as ours."," The system is still being developed constantly.

Just was frustrating. Thanks for listening.", I like how I know how to make my own rounds and like inspections for those rounds.
